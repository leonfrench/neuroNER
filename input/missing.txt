the three GAD-positive rat neurons were non-accommodating (see Fig. 4C), while the one GAD-negative
rat neuron exhibited spike accommodation (data not shown). 
twelve neurons classified as FS cells were immunopositive for parvalbumin
 Schiess et al. (1999) classified CeA neurons as either type A (no accommodation) or type B (with accommodation). Our results are consistent with this classification of CeA cells and their general morphology, showing that non-accommodating type A cells are smaller than accommodating type B cells, but the two types have overlapping shapes
 Both glutamate and GABA synaptic transmission in CeA neurons have been characterize
