Calcium channelopathy mutants and their role in ocular motor research.
Thanks to technical advances in eye movement recording, the mouse is destined to become increasingly important in ocular motor research. An advantage of this species is the wide range of existing mutant strains and techniques to generate new mutations affecting specific cell types. Mutations of ion channels may be used to modulate the intrinsic properties of neurons, and this approach may generate insight into the degree to which neuronal computations depend upon those intrinsic properties as opposed to the properties of circuits of neurons. Dendritic calcium currents carried by P-type voltage-activated calcium channels have been widely postulated to perform important computational functions in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Mutations of this channel lead to human diseases, and several ataxic strains of mice are now known to harbor mutations of this calcium channel. Murine P-channel mutants such as rocker are ataxic, but have normal or near-normal numbers of cerebellar Purkinje cells and thus offer the opportunity to study the effects of biophysical perturbations as opposed to outright cell destruction or inactivation. Initial studies of rocker mice reveal an array of ocular motor abnormalities, including static hyperdeviation of the eyes and an attenuation of vestibulo-ocular reflex gains at high stimulus frequencies. The pattern of gain and phase abnormalities is entirely different in lurcher, an ataxic mutant in which Purkinje cells degenerate. The ocular motor abnormalities of rocker progress with animal age, underscoring the importance of careful attention to animal age when performing ocular motor studies in this short-lived species.
