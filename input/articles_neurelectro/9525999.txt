Mouse cerebellar granule cell differentiation: electrical activity regulates the GABAA receptor alpha 6 subunit gene.
GABAA receptor alpha6 subunit gene expression marks cerebellar granule cell maturation. To study this process, we used the Deltaalpha6lacZ mouse line, which has a lacZ reporter inserted into the alpha6 gene. At early stages of postnatal cerebellar development, alpha6-lacZ expression is mosaic; expression starts at postnatal day 5 in lobules 9 and 10, and alpha6-lacZ is switched on inside-out, appearing first in the deepest postmigratory granule cells. We looked for factors regulating this expression in cell culture. Membrane depolarization correlates inversely with alpha6-lacZ expression: granule cells grown in 25 mM [K+]o for 11-15 d do not express the alpha6 gene, whereas cultures grown for the same period in 5 mM [K+]o do. This is influenced by a critical early period: culturing for >/=3 d in 25 mM [K+]o curtails the ability to induce the alpha6 gene on transfer to 5 mM [K+]o. If the cells start in 5 mM [K+]o, however, they still express the alpha6-lacZ gene in 25 mM [K+]o. In contrast to granule cells grown in 5 mM [K+]o, cells cultured in 25 mM [K+]o exhibit no action potentials, mEPSCs, or mIPSCs. In chronic 5 mM [K+]o, factors may therefore be released that induce alpha6. Blockade of ionotropic and metabotropic GABA and glutamate receptors or L-, N-, and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels did not prevent alpha6-lacZ expression, but inhibition of action potentials with tetrodotoxin blocked expression in a subpopulation of cells.
