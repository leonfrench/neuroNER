Synaptic plasticity in CNGA3(-/-) mice: cone bipolar cells react on the missing cone input and form ectopic synapses with rods.
In the mammalian retina, rods and cones connect to distinct sets of bipolar cells. Rods are presynaptic to a single type of rod bipolar cell, whereas cones connect to different types of cone bipolar cells. Synaptic rewiring between cone photoreceptor terminals and rod bipolar cell dendrites has been described as a general result of photoreceptor degeneration. To investigate whether cone bipolar cells also show synaptic plasticity in the absence of cone input, we studied the connectivity of cone bipolar cell dendrites in CNGA3(-/-) mice, a model with specific loss of cone photoreceptor function. Dendritic connections of ON and OFF cone bipolar cells were visualized using specific cell markers or by intracellular injection with fluorescent dyes. The results show that cone bipolar cells in CNGA3(-/-) mice form ectopic synapses with rods. In contrast, cone bipolar cells do not form ectopic synapses with rods in CNGA3(-/-)Rho(-/-) mice, in which both types of photoreceptors are nonfunctional. In analogy with these results, we found that input-deprived rod bipolar cells form ectopic synapses with functional cones in Rho(-/-) mice but not with inoperable cones in the CNGA3(-/-)Rho(-/-) mouse. Our data indicate that the formation of ectopic bipolar cell synapses in the outer plexiform layer requires a functional presynaptic photoreceptor.
