Differential activation and desensitization of sensory neurons by resiniferatoxin.
Recently, with use of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons we have been able to dissociate the binding affinities of vanilloids from their potencies to induce 45Ca uptake, which suggests the existence of distinct classes of the vanilloid receptor (). In the present study, we have demonstrated that the ultrapotent capsaicin analog resiniferatoxin (RTX) desensitized rat DRG neurons to the subsequent induction of 45Ca uptake by capsaicin and RTX with affinity and cooperativity similar to that found for [3H]RTX binding, contrasting with a approximately 10-fold weaker potency and lack of cooperativity to induce 45Ca uptake. Likewise, the competitive antagonist capsazepine inhibited RTX-induced desensitization with potency similar to that for inhibition of specific [3H]RTX binding, whereas the potency of capsazepine was approximately 10-fold higher for inhibiting RTX-induced 45Ca uptake. Finally, the noncompetitive antagonist ruthenium red inhibited both the RTX-induced desensitization and 45Ca uptake but showed approximately 60-fold selectivity for inhibiting RTX-induced desensitization. The RTX-induced desensitization was not associated with loss of specific [3H]RTX binding, suggesting lack of gross cell toxicity. In contrast to RTX, capsaicin caused desensitization with a potency corresponding to that for 45Ca uptake and did so in a noncooperative manner. Unlike the RTX-induced desensitization, the desensitization by capsaicin was blocked by ruthenium red only at doses that blocked 45Ca uptake and depended on external calcium. Our findings provide further support for the existence of vanilloid receptor subtypes on DRG neurons with distinct pharmacology and distinct patterns of desensitization.
