Strontium supports synaptic transmission and long-lasting potentiation in the hippocampus.
(1) Synaptic transmission was studied in isolated transverse hippocampal slices from guinea pigs. Extracellular evoked potentials were recorded in the region CA1. (2) Changing the normal perfusion solution (containing 2 mM Ca2+) to calcium-free Ringer abolished synaptic transmission which was again restored by adding strontium. A synaptic efficacy of 25--50% ofn normal was obtained for 10 mM Sr2+. (3) Two different synaptic inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells were tested with respect to their ability to produce long-lasting synaptic potentiation after tetanization in strontium Ringer. Following a brief tetanus the field EPSP and, especially, the population spike were greatly enhanced. (4) The potentiation so produced was similar to the long-lasting potentiation seen in the normal slice, because it (i) had a very long duration (hours), (ii) was specific for the tetanized pathway, (iii) showed potentiation of both 'volley-EPSP' and 'EPSP-spike' relations, and (iv) was accompanied by short-lasting (less than 5 min) generalized depression.
