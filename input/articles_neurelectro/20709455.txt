Enhanced scratching evoked by PAR-2 agonist and 5-HT but not histamine in a mouse model of chronic dry skin itch.
Chronic itch is a symptom of many skin conditions and systemic disease, and it has been hypothesized that the chronic itch may result from sensitization of itch-signaling pathways. We induced experimental chronic dry skin on the rostral back of mice, and observed a significant increase in spontaneous hindlimb scratches directed to the dry skin. Spontaneous scratching was significantly attenuated by a PAR-2 antibody and 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, indicating activation of these receptors by endogenous mediators released under dry skin conditions. We also observed a significant increase in the number of scratch bouts evoked by acute intradermal injections of a protease-activated receptor (PAR)-2 agonist and serotonin (5-HT), but not histamine. We additionally investigated if pruritogen-evoked activity of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons is enhanced in this model. DRG cells from dry skin mice exhibited significantly larger responses to the PAR-2 agonist and 5-HT, but not histamine. Spontaneous scratching may reflect ongoing itch, and enhanced pruritogen-evoked scratching may represent hyperknesis (enhanced itch), both potentially due to sensitization of itch-signaling neurons. The correspondence between enhanced behavioral scratching and DRG cell responses suggest that peripheral pruriceptors that respond to proteases and 5-HT, but not histamine, may be sensitized in dry skin itch.
