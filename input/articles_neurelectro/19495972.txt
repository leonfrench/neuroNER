Age-related changes in the insulin receptor β in the gerbil hippocampus.
The insulin receptor has been reported to be associated with memory formation via the hippocampus. In this study, we observed age-related changes in the insulin receptor β immunoreactivity and its protein levels in the hippocampus of gerbils of various ages in order to identify the correlation between the insulin receptor β and aging processes in the hippocampus. Insulin receptor β immunoreactivity was mainly detected in the molecular and polymorphic layers of the dentate gyrus, and in mossy fibers, Schaffer collaterals, alveus and stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the hippocampus proper (CA1-3) of gerbils at postnatal month 1 (PM 1). Insulin receptor β immunoreactivity decreased with age in all of these structures, except for the alveus. Reduction of the insulin receptor β immunoreactivity was prominent in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus at PM 6 and in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 region at PM 12, while insulin receptor β immunoreactivity was decreased in other regions in the PM 18 groups. In addition, insulin receptor β protein level in the whole hippocampus was slightly increased at PM 3, and it decreased in an age-dependent manner from PM 6 to PM 24. These reductions of the insulin receptor β in the hippocampus may be associated with age-related memory deficits in gerbils.
