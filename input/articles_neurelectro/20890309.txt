Growth factor receptor-bound protein 14: a new modulator of photoreceptor-specific cyclic-nucleotide-gated channel.
Growth factor receptor-bound protein 14 (Grb14) is an adaptor protein that is involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signalling. In this study, we report that Grb14 interacts with the rod photoreceptor-specific cyclic-nucleotide-gated channel alpha subunit (CNGA1) and decreases its affinity for cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Channel modulation is controlled by direct binding of the Grb14 Ras-associating domain with the carboxy-terminal region of CNGA1. We observed that the channel remains open in Grb14(-/-) mice that are exposed to light, suggesting that Grb14 is a normal physiological modulator of CNG channel function in vivo.
