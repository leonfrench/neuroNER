PICK1 is required for the control of synaptic transmission by the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7.
Both postsynaptic density and presynaptic active zone are structural matrix containing scaffolding proteins that are involved in the organization of the synapse. Little is known about the functional role of these proteins in the signaling of presynaptic receptors. Here we show that the interaction of the presynaptic metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor subtype, mGlu7a, with the postsynaptic density-95 disc-large zona occludens 1 (PDZ) domain-containing protein, PICK1, is required for specific inhibition of P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels, in cultured cerebellar granule neurons. Furthermore, we show that activation of the presynaptic mGlu7a receptor inhibits synaptic transmission and this effect also requires the presence of PICK1. These results indicate that the scaffolding protein, PICK1, plays an essential role in the control of synaptic transmission by the mGlu7a receptor complex.
