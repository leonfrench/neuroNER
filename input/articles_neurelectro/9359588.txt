Mu and delta opioids but not kappa opioid inhibit voltage-activated Ba2+ currents in neuronal F-11 cell.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to study Ba2+ currents through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in dorsal root ganglion x mouse neuroblastoma hybrid (F-11) cells. Opioid agonists selective for either mu (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Mephe-Gly-ol; DAMGO) or delta (Tyr-D-Pen-Gly-Phe-D-Pen-OH; DPDPE) receptors inhibited high-threshold Ba2+ currents. The inhibition was reversible, naloxone-sensitive, and dose-dependent. The inhibitory effects of both DAMGO and DPDPE were blocked by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (PTX) as well as by brief exposure to the sulfhydryl alkylating agent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). The N-type Ca2+ channel antagonist omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CTX GVIA) irreversibly inhibited high threshold Ba2+ currents by 66% and blocked the inhibitory effect of DAMGO or DPDPE. In contrast, the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine inhibited high threshold Ba2+ currents by 15% and failed to block the inhibitory effect of DAMGO or DPDPE. These results demonstrate that mu and delta opioid receptors are negatively coupled to N-type Ca2+ channels via PTX- and NEM-sensitive GTP-binding proteins in F-11 cells.
