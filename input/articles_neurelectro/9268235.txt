Granule cell apoptosis and protein expression in hippocampal dentate gyrus after forebrain ischemia in the rat.
We investigated the relationship between apoptosis and selective protein expression in brain from rats subjected to 8 (n=10) or 12 min (n=10) of forebrain ischemia and 48 h of reperfusion, and control sham operated (n=2) and normal (n=2). Coronal sections were processed for double staining with DNA fragmentation detection and immunohistochemical staining. In five of ten 8-min ischemic and three of ten 12-min ischemic animals, nearly all dead granule cells within the dentate gyrus exhibited apoptotic morphology. In the remaining animals, no granule cell death was evident. In the pyramidal regions (CA1/2), nearly all dead cells were necrotic with only scattered apoptotic cells present. The immunoreactive expression of wt-p53, p53-response proteins (WAF1, Bax and Gadd45), and a cell cycle protein (cyclin D) were detected and preferentially localized to nuclei of apoptotic granule cells, and were weakly expressed in nuclei of necrotic pyramidal CA1/2 cells. Thus, 48 h after 8 or 12 min of forebrain ischemia in the rat, most pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells undergo distinct cell death pathways of necrosis or apoptosis, respectively. In addition, the selective expression of proteins associated with DNA damage and cell cycle in apoptotic dentate granule cells suggests a role for these proteins in the induction of apoptosis.
