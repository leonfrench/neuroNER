Localization of olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channels in rat gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons.
The GT1 GnRH cell lines express all three subunits of the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels (CNG2, 4.3 and 5) expressed in olfactory neurons. We investigated using in situ hybridization and double immunofluorescence whether endogenous GnRH neurons in therat also express CNG channel subunits. Sections from male and female adult rats were hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe made to regions of rat GnRH, CNG2, CNG4.3 or CNG5 cDNAs. In both sexes, 70-80% of GnRH neurons contained mRNAs for CNG2, CNG4.3 and CNG5. Similarly, double immunofluorescence staining for GnRH and CNG2, CNG4.3 or CNG5 confirmed that 70-80% of GnRH perikarya contained all three CNG subunit proteins. Moreover, the distribution of the immunostaining of CNG subunits in the external layer of the median eminence overlapped with GnRH with the presence of functional cAMP-gated cation channels. The presence of CNG channel subunits in the median eminence supports the notion that coordination of the excitability of the scattered GnRH perikarya may occur at the level of the nerve terminals.
