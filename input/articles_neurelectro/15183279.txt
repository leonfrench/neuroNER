How the choice of method influence on the results in electrophysiological studies of insect olfaction.
In identifying the volatiles that insects use to locate suitable host plants, electrophysiological recordings of olfactory responses to plant volatiles may give important information. However, divergent results may be obtained with different recording techniques. To illustrate these differences, the results of a previous investigation using single cell recordings linked to a gas chromatograph (SCR-GC) are compared with the results obtained with an electroantennogram linked to a gas chromatograph (EAG-GC). Testing insects of the same species (Hylobius abietis) for the same test sample, 30 potent volatile compounds were identified by SCR-GC and 18 by EAG-GC. Of the 34 different compounds, 14 were identified by both techniques. Furthermore, when the same compound elicited detectable responses by both techniques, the response strength was usually not the same relative to the strongest response recorded by each technique. This shows that both EAG-GC and SCR-GC are important techniques in the identification of potent plant volatiles for insects. However, by using SCR-GC more information was obtained, information that can be crucial for understanding the insect-plant relationship.
