Distinct omega-agatoxin-sensitive calcium currents in somata and axon terminals of rat supraoptic neurones.
1. Voltage-dependent calcium currents were measured at room temperature using whole-cell patch clamp in acutely isolated somata and axon terminals of the magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) from the rat supraoptic nucleus. 2. Administration of omega-agatoxin IVA (omega-Aga IVA) blocked a high-threshold non-inactivating current. This current has an IC50 for omega-Aga IVA of 3 nM; no other types of currents were blocked at doses of up to 500 nM. 3. In the axon terminals omega-Aga IVA blocked a high-threshold current that inactivates markedly (tau approximately 448 ms), and has a much lower sensitivity to the toxin, with an IC50 of 270 nM. Unlike the somatic current, the effect of omega-Aga IVA in the terminals is largely prevented by omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTX). 4. These data suggest that MNC somata express a single type of omega-Aga IVA-sensitive calcium current similar to the P-type calcium current described in other cells. However, the omega-Aga IVA-sensitive current in axon terminals differs from both the P-type and the recently identified Q-type current in that it is also sensitive to omega-CgTX. The distinct biophysical properties of the currents in somata and axon terminals may have important physiological implications.
