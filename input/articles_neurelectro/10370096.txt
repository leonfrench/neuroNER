Regulation of L- and N-types of Ca2+ channels by intracellular ATP4- in frog dorsal root ganglion neurons.
The roles of free Mg2+ ions, ATP4- ions and Mg-ATP complexes in the regulation of N- and L-types of Ca2+ channels were studied in frog dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Because Mg2+ ions interact with ATP4- ions to form Mg-ATP complexes, addition of one species can influence the concentrations of the other two. In this study their concentrations were carefully controlled by varying the concentrations of two constituents at a time while keeping the third constant. The effects of each of the three species on barium currents through L-type (IBaL) and N-type (IBaN) Ca2+ channels were plotted against its concentrations. The dose-response curves for ATP4- show that IBaL and IBaN proportionally increased with ATP4- concentrations up to 1 mM at three different Mg2+ concentrations. At a fixed concentration of ATP4-, IBaL and IBaN remained unchanged even when pMg changed from 3 to 5. Dose-response curves for IBaL and IBaN plotted against Mg-ATP concentration did not show a consistent pattern. H-7 and Mg2+ ions did not exert any blocking effect on the activity of either Ca2+ channel type, and neither dibutyryl-cAMP nor NKH-477 had any stimulating effect, suggesting that phosphorylation is not likely to be involved in ATP-induced potentiation. From these observations, it is concluded that L-type and N-type Ca2+ channels in frog DRG neurons are regulated by ATP4- ions alone, and that the neuronal Ca2+ channels are regulated by mechanisms that are different from those regulating the cardiac Ca2+ channels.
