Rip immunoreactivity significantly decreases in the stratum oriens of hippocampal CA1 region after transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils.
In the present study, we observed ischemia-related changes in Rip recognizing the promyelinating and myelinating oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus proper after 5 min of transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils. Rip immunoreactivity was significantly altered in the hippocampal CA1 region but not in the CA2/3 region after ischemic insult. In the sham-operated group, Rip immunoreactivity was shown in the cell bodies and processes of oligodendrocytes in all layers of the hippocampus proper. From 15 min to 2 days after ischemic insult, Rip immunoreactivity was similar to that of sham-operated group. Three days after ischemic insult, Rip-immunoreactive processes were tangled in the stratum oriens of the CA1 region, and Rip protein level decreased from this time after ischemia. Thereafter, Rip immunoreactivity was decreased time dependently in the CA1 region. Seven days after ischemic insult, Rip-immunoreactive processes were tangled and densely detected in the stratum oriens adjacent to the stratum pyramidale. In brief, these results indicate that the significant decrease of Rip immunoreactivity in processes in the stratum oriens of the hippocampal CA1 region occurs at late time after ischemia, and this decrease in Rip immunoreactivity may be associated with delayed neuronal death of CA1 pyramidal cells.
