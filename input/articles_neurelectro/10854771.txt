Efferent function of vestibular afferent endings? Similar localization of N-type calcium channels, synaptic vesicle and synaptic membrane-associated proteins.
We investigated the distribution of N-type voltage-dependent calcium channels that mediate Ca(2+) entry initiating transmitter release in the rat vestibular sensory epithelium. We used confocal microscopy to assess the in vitro labeling by fluorescent specific ligand binding, omega-conotoxin-GVIA and also the immunolabeling of presynaptic soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins, syntaxin, 25,000 mol. wt synaptosome-associated protein and synaptotagmin: components of the neurotransmitter exocytosis machinery. We found that there was a close anatomical association between the voltage-gated calcium channels, the synaptic vesicle and synaptic membrane-associated proteins on the afferent nerve calyces and probably afferent boutons, which are postsynaptic compartments. Our data suggest that these peripheral afferent endings possess the presynaptic Ca(2+) channels and the components of the presynaptic SNARE proteins involved in synaptic vesicle docking and calcium-dependent exocytosis. They provide additional evidence for a secretory function and efferent role of these endings in hair cell neurotransmission.
