Involvement of the TTX-resistant sodium channel Nav 1.8 in inflammatory and neuropathic, but not post-operative, pain states.
Antisense (AS) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) targeting the Nav 1.8 sodium channel have been reported to decrease inflammatory hyperalgesia and L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation-induced mechanical allodynia in rats. The present studies were conducted to further characterize Nav 1.8 AS antinociceptive profile in rats to better understand the role of Nav 1.8 in different pain states. Consistent with earlier reports, chronic intrathecal Nav 1.8 AS, but not mismatch (MM), ODN decreased TTX-resistant sodium current density (by 60.5+/-10.2% relative to MM; p<0.05) in neurons from L4 to L5 dorsal root ganglia and significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia following intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant. In addition, 10 days following chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, Nav 1.8 AS, but not MM, ODN also attenuated mechanical allodynia (54.3+/-8.2% effect, p<0.05 vs. MM) 2 days after initiation of ODN treatment. The anti-allodynic effects remained for the duration of the AS treatment, and CCI rats returned to an allodynic state 4 days after discontinuing AS. In contrast, Nav 1.8 AS ODN failed to reduce mechanical allodynia in the vincristine chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain model or a skin-incision model of post-operative pain. Finally, Nav 1.8 AS, but not MM, ODN treatment produced a small but significant attenuation of acute noxious mechanical sensitivity in naÃ¯ve animals (17.6+/-6.2% effect, p<0.05 vs. MM). These data demonstrate a greater involvement of Nav 1.8 in frank nerve injury and inflammatory pain as compared to acute, post-operative or chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain states.
