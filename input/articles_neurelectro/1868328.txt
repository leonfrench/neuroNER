Effects of lingual nerve and chewing cortex stimulation upon activity of the swallowing neurons located in the region of the hypoglossal motor nucleus.
This study focuses on motoneurons and interneurons in the region of the hypoglossal nucleus (XIIth) related to swallowing and chewing. In sheep anesthetized with halothane, we have used extracellular microelectrodes to study the effects of stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN), the lingual nerve (LN) and the chewing cortex (CCx) upon activities of the swallowing neurons (SNs). Ipsilateral stimulation (1-5 pulses at 500 Hz) of the peripheral afferents or CCx did not generally induce a short latency activation of the hypoglossal swallowing motoneurons (Group I SNs) since only 4 motoneurons (69 tested) were activated by the SLN, 4 motoneurons (56 tested) by the LN and none by the CCx. In contrast, the same stimulations were more effective with swallowing interneurons (Group II SNs) located in the reticular formation close to the XIIth motor nucleus since 12 neurons (30 tested) were activated with short latencies (9 +/- 1.8 ms; mean latency +/- S.D.) by the SLN, 9 neurons (21 tested) by the LN (latency; 8 +/- 1.8 ms) and 5 neurons (18 tested) by the CCx (latency: 13 +/- 1.7 ms). Seven neurons were activated by two or three modes of stimulation indicating the existence of convergent inputs upon some Group II SNs. During chewing movements induced by a prolonged stimulation (20-40 Hz) of the CCx, 10 Group I SNs (16 tested) versus only one Group II SN (8 tested) were found to fire in association with the jaw opening. Moreover, 3 motoneurons and 4 interneurons inactive during swallowing discharged during chewing movements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
