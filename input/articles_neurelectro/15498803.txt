The 'window' T-type calcium current in brain dynamics of different behavioural states.
All three forms of recombinant low voltage-activated T-type Ca(2)(+) channels (Ca(v)3.1, Ca(v)3.2 and Ca(v)3.3) exhibit a small, though clearly evident, window T-type Ca(2)(+) current (I(Twindow)) which is also present in native channels from different neuronal types. In thalamocortical (TC) and nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT) neurones, and possibly in neocortical cells, an I(Twindow)-mediated bistability is the key cellular mechanism underlying the expression of the slow (< 1 Hz) sleep oscillation, one of the fundamental EEG rhythms of non-REM sleep. As the I(Twindow)-mediated bistability may also represent one of the cellular mechanisms underlying the expression of high frequency burst firing in awake conditions, I(Twindow) is of critical importance in neuronal population dynamics associated with different behavioural states.
