The expression of somatostatin receptors in the hippocampus of pilocarpine-induced rat epilepsy model.
During the course of this study, we sought examine whether the expression of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) is altered in the hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in order to understand the role/function of SSTRs in the hippocampus after epileptogenic insults. SSTR1 and SSTR4 immunoreactivities were increased in the hippocampus at 1 week after SE. At 4 weeks after SE, SRIF1-family (SSTR 2A, SSTR2B, and SSTR5) immunoreactivity was increased only in neuropil. Both SSTR2A and 2B immunoreactivities were increased in CA2-3 pyramidal cells. However, SSTR3 and SSTR4 immunoreactivities were reduced in the CA1 pyramidal cells of epileptic rat due to neuronal loss. In addition, SSTR5 immunoreactivity was reduced in CA2 pyramidal cells and various interneurons. Both SSTR2B and SSTR4 immunoreactivities were increased within microglia following SE. Our findings suggest that increases in neuron-glial SSTR expressions may be closely related to the enhanced inhibition of the dentate gyrus and regulation of reactive microgliosis in the hippocampus of a pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.
