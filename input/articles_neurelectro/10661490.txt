Adenosine A1 receptors inhibit Ca2+ channels coupled to the release of ACh, but not of GABA, in cultured retina cells.
We investigated the effect of adenosine A1 receptors on the release of acetylcholine (ACh) and GABA, and on the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) response in cultured chick amacrine-like neurons, stimulated by KCl depolarization. The KCl-induced release of [3H]ACh, but not the release of [14C]GABA, was potentiated when adenosine A1 receptor activation was prevented by perfusing the cells with adenosine deaminase (ADA) or with 1,3-dipropyl-8-cycloentylxanthine (DPCPX). The changes in the [Ca2+]i induced by KCl depolarization, measured in neurite segments of single cultured cells, were also modulated by endogenous adenosine, acting on adenosine A1 receptors. Our results show that adenosine A1 receptors inhibit Ca2+ entry coupled to ACh release, but not to the release of GABA, suggesting that the synaptic vesicles containing each neurotransmitter are located in different zones of the neurites, containing different VSCC and/or different densities of adenosine A1 receptors.
