Versatile regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ by vanilloid receptor I in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons.
Analysis of small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons revealed novel functions for vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1) in the regulation of cytosolic Ca(2+). The VR1 agonist capsaicin induced Ca(2+) mobilization from intracellular stores in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+), and this release was inhibited by the VR1 antagonist capsazepine but was unaffected by the phospholipase C inhibitor xestospongins, indicating that Ca(2+) mobilization was dependent on capsaicin receptor binding and was not due to intracellular inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate generation. Confocal microscopy revealed extensive expression of VR1 on endoplasmic reticulum, consistent with VR1 operating as a Ca(2+) release receptor. The main part of the capsaicin-releasable Ca(2+) store was insensitive to thapsigargin, a selective endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, suggesting that VR1 might be predominantly localized to a thapsigargin-insensitive endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) store. In addition, VR1 was observed to behave as a store-operated Ca(2+) influx channel. In DRG neurons, capsazepine attenuated Ca(2+) influx following thapsigargin-induced Ca(2+) store depletion and inhibited thapsigargin-induced inward currents. Conversely, transfected HEK-293 cells expressing VR1 showed enhanced Ca(2+) influx and inward currents following Ca(2+) store depletion. Combined data support topographical and functional diversity for VR1 in the regulation of cytosolic Ca(2+) with the plasma membrane-associated form behaving as a store-operated Ca(2+) influx channel and endoplasmic reticulum-associated VR1 possibly functioning as a Ca(2+) release receptor in sensory neurons.
