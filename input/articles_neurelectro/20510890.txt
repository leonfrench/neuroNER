Distribution of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in the inner ear.
Migraine and anxiety disorders are frequently co-morbid with balance disorders. This study examined the relative distribution of subtypes of serotonin (5-HT) receptor in the inner ear of monkeys and rats. Most vestibular ganglion cells were immunoreactive for 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors in macaques and rats. In the inner ear, 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptor immunopositivity was associated with endothelial cells of the vestibular ganglion, spiral ganglion, vestibulocochlear nerve, spiral ligament and stria vascularis. It was noteworthy that 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors are expressed in parallel sites in peripheral vestibular and trigeminal systems, which may be a factor underlying the efficacy of triptans in treating migraine and migrainous vertigo. Because the vestibular ganglion and trigeminal ganglion are both within the subarachnoid space, an interaction between 5-HT(1B) and TRPV1 receptors on blood vessel and ganglion cells may also contribute to the vasospasm and the comorbid headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting that accompany subarachnoid hemorrhage.
