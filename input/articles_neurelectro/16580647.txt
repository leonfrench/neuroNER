Immunohistochemical study on the distribution of TRPC channels in the rat hippocampus.
In the present study, we performed immunohistochemistry using antibodies directed against TRPCs to study the localizations of these channels in rat hippocampus. The pyramidal cell bodies of CA1-3 areas and the granule cell bodies of the dentate gyrus were immunoreactive for TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4 and TRPC5. On the other hand, TRPC6 exhibited the cloud-like neuropil staining only in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. As a whole, the present study has clearly shown the localization of TRPCs in rat hippocampus and may provide useful data for the future investigations on the structural and functional properties of TRPCs.
