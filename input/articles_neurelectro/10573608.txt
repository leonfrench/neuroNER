Co-localization of Shaker A-type K+ channel (Kv1.4) and AMPA-glutamate receptor (GluR4) immunoreactivities to dendrites of OFF-bipolar cells of goldfish retina.
Immunocytochemical methods were used to determine the comparative distribution of Shaker Kv1.4 and Shal Kv4.2 A-type voltage-gated K(+) channels and AMPA-type GluR4 glutamate receptors in the goldfish retina. Kv1.4-immunoreactivity (IR) was restricted to a very narrow band of bright puncta and filamentous processes in the outer plexiform layer (OPL), whereas GluR4-IR was found in radial processes of MÃ¼ller cells in addition to a narrow band in the OPL. Kv4.2-IR was most prominent over cell bodies of horizontal cell, amacrine cells and ganglion cells, with very weak labeling over the synaptic terminal of cone photoreceptors. Double label experiments revealed complete co-localization of Kv1.4-IR and GluR4-IR in the OPL and showed that the Kv1.4 puncta in the OPL appeared enclosed by the Kv4.2-IR cone terminals. Electron microscopical immunocytochemistry showed that Kv1.4-IR and GluR4-IR were restricted to the dendrites of OFF-bipolar cells that innervated cone photoreceptor terminals and thin processes that coursed between the rod and cone terminals in the OPL. These data are consistent with other studies demonstrating the selective clustering of A-type voltage-gated K(+) channels and ionotropic glutamate receptors. However, they differ from mammalian preparations in which Shal-like Kv4.2 rather than Shaker-like Kv1.4 co-localize postsynaptically with glutamate receptors.
