Expression of sigma receptor 1 mRNA and protein in rat retina.
Sigma receptor (sigmaR), known as a unique nonopiate, nonphencyclidine brain receptor, can bind diverse classes of psychotropic drugs, neurosteroids and other synthetic compounds, such as (+)pentazocine, etc. Two types of sigmaRs have been identified: sigmaR1 and sigmaR2. In this work, we examined the expression of sigmaR1 in rat retina by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactive (RT-PCR) analysis and immunofluorescence double labeling. RT-PCR analysis showed that sigmaR1 mRNA was present in rat retina. Furthermore, labeling for sigmaR1 was diffusely distributed in the outer and inner plexiform layers. The sigmaR1-immunoreactivity (IR) was also observed in many cells in the inner nuclear layer and the ganglion cell layer. In the outer retina sigmaR1 was expressed in all horizontal cells labeled by calbindin. In contrast, no sigmaR1-IR was detected in several subtypes of bipolar cells, including rod-dominant ON-type bipolar cells, types 2, 3, 5 and 8 bipolar cells, labeled by protein kinase C (PKC), recoverin and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 4 (HCN4) respectively. In the inner retina, most of GABAergic amacrine cells, including dopaminergic and cholinergic ones, stained by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) respectively, expressed sigmaR1. Some glycinergic amacrine cells were also labeled by sigmaR1, but glycinergic AII amacrine cells were not labeled. In addition, sigmaR1-IR was seen in almost all somata of the ganglion cells retrogradely labeled by fluorogold. These results suggest that sigmaR1 may have neuromodulatory and neuroprotective roles in the retina.
