In the cingulate cortex (CG), the five populations represented three major classes of interneurons2, 9 (parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking basket cells, somatostatin-positive regular-spiking bipolar and multipolar cells, and cholecystokinin-positive irregular-spiking bipolar and multipolar cells) and two major classes of projection neurons (thick-tufted layer 5 nonadapting pyramidal neurons and layer 6 adapting corticothalamic neurons; Fig. 1).

E12 induction gave rise to cortical GABA neurons expressing parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), but not vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (Figure 2J-L).

Dlx genes continue to express in subsets of GABAergic neurons in embryonic, postnatal, and mature brains, 

In mature cortex (P21), both cohorts settled in deep cortical layers despite their different migration routes, with a larger fraction of Dlx5-CreER labeled neurons situated deeper in layer 6 than Dlx1-CreER labeled neurons

Many of these interneurons showed bipolar morphology and were reminiscent of CGE-derived populations such as VIP or CR positive interneurons.
