17698015	290	Given that layer 5 neurons located in the same cortical column are highly interconnected (Markram et al., 1997) and that up-states are highly synchronized across neocortical pyramidal neurons (Petersen et al., 2003; Steriade et al., 1993), even a modest increase in layer 5 to layer 5 connection strength could have a profound impact on strengthening network coupling and synchronization in the cortex.

16701210	197	Different Pre- and Postsynaptic Roles for GABAB1a and GABAB1b Activation of GABAB receptors on neocortical pyramidal neurons leads to the generation of slow K+-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (Benardo, 1994; Ga ̈ hwiler and Brown, 1985; Newberry and Nicoll, 1984; Shao and Burkhalter, 1999; Tamas et al., 2003).

12759179	44	We recorded from 26 layer 5 cells and 13 layers 2/3 cells in which we were able to assess firing properties, input resistances, time constants, and the latencies of excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked at different laminar and lateral positions.
15772358	184	In summary, the direction selectivity of the spike re- (range, 6 –11 mV) were comparable for all cells.
9592109	99	That these effects were not systematic was revealed by the fact that averages over several complex cells (and RF positions) yielded smooth, peaked tuning curves.
20927409	7	Functionally, asynchronous release decreases fast-spiking-cell spike reliability and reduces the ability of P neurons to integrate incoming stimuli into precise firing.
19641119	25	The medial prefrontal cortex receives monosynaptic glutamatergic inputs from many brain structures including the mediodorsal thalamus (Krettek and Price, 1977; Giguere and Goldman-Rakic, 1988) and the CA1 area and subiculum of the hippocampus (Swanson, 1981; Jay and Witter, 1991; Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007; Hoover and Vertes, 2007) innervating both pyramidal cells and interneurons (Gabbott et al., 2002; Kuroda et al., 2004; Tierney et al., 2004; Rotaru et al., 2005).
20927409	313	Polysynaptic activation would imply that stimulation of a fast-spiking neuron is capable of triggering spikes in some synaptically connected cells, which would then activate other interneurons, leading to a feedback inhibition.

22798946	349	They will also recruit thick-tufted pyramidal neurons but to a significantly lesser degree.
19474331	195	Together, these results show that immature G42 fast-spiking interneurons are initially highly excitable, integrate inputs over long ( 35 ms) time windows, and respond to sustained input with relatively low-frequency adapting spike trains and that over the next 2 weeks of development fast-spiking cells become progressively and dramatically harder to excite, sensitive only to coincident input, and capable of very high-frequency repetitive firing without adaptation once driven past threshold.
17317752	191	This is most likely caused by a lack of knowledge about the identity of responding cells.

16701210	291	The population of L1 interneurons is basically differentiated into two groups in adult rodents: multipolar cells, whose axons are vertically oriented extending into deeper cortical layers; and neurogliaform interneurons, whose axons extend horizontally in L1 contacting the apical tufts of pyramidal neurons (Chu et al., 2003; Hestrin and Armstrong, 1996).

22798946	252	In these studies it was found that both layer 2 and layer 3 pyramidal neurons above a barrel are strongly excited by the subjacent layer 4 neurons (see above) while layer 2 pyramidal neurons above a septum between barrels are more excited by L5A pyramidal neurons.
8574660	278	Our results suggest that high and low threshold Ca2+ currents may contribute towards facilitating and shaping burst discharges, but they do not suggest that Ca2+ plays a major role in promoting bursting activities in neocortical in bursting pyramidal neurons.
15456817	102	The proportion of boutons of which the postsynaptic targets are cell bodies is indeed very small for spiny cells (McGuire et al., 1984; Kisva ́ rday et al., 1986; Gabbott et al., 1987; Somogyi, 1989; Anderson et al., 1994a), double bouquet cells (Somogyi and Cowey, 1981; Freund et al., 1986; Tama ́ s et al., 1997, 1998), dendrite targeting cells (Somogyi and Cowey, 1981; Freund et al., 1986; Tama ́ s et al., 1997, 1998), and thalamic afferents (Garey and Powell, 1971; McGuire et al., 1984; Freund et al., 1985).
15115747	16	Under normal circumstances, pyramidal cells are continuously bombarded by inputs (Steriade et al., 2001) and it is not clear how these timing-dependent mechanisms are influenced by quasi-random fluctuations in membrane potential.

14645486	301	The proportion of feedforward pathways and feedback inputs (11–12%) to parvalbumin neurons is similar to that (9 – 10%) of asymmetric inputs in the neuropil (Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1999a), suggesting that relative to the total input, feedforward pathways and feedback axons have no particular preference for parvalbumin neurons.
20927409	264	Importantly, these experiments were performed using a local perfusion system that efficiently removed ambient GABA, as evidenced by the lack of significant change in the total fast-spiking-cell membrane resistance when switching the flow from control to gabazine, and back to control solution (Figure 7G; 160620 MV versus 140617 MV versus 162618 MV; p.0.05), ruling out a role for tonic inhibition in these effects.
15737062	396	The positive direction for the vector from the mean positions of the cells to the estimated average position of the main apical dendrites was defined to be the pia direction in the slice.

19295167	89	This parametric description of the firing pattern allows to differentiate the three different firing classes described above: bursting neurons are characterized by a high F and a min pronounced adaptation, accelerating neurons exhibit a negative adaptation and a low F , whereas continuous firing neurons exhibit intermemin diate F and adaptation (10).
15539396	350	To try and sort out one of the above hypotheses we simulated the b-action potential in a compartmental model of a bitufted interneurone (Fig. 11).

17122323	435	After this global inhibition, voltage-dependent depolarization resulting from tonic mAChR activation could amplify the firing of neurons receiving the strongest (and hence most behaviorally appropriate) synaptic drive.
15182718	79	This segmentation is projected onto layer 2/3 neurons above barrels and septa, with cells above septa receiving less input originating from layer 4 on average than cells above barrels (Shepherd et al., 2003).

19295167	248	Similarly, cluster 2.2.2.1 neurons rarely expressed Neuropeptide Y (18%) (Fig. 1 A) compared with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (77%; see Table 3).
22798946	275	Besides the vertical signal transformation within the home column of the pyramidal neurons, axons collaterals of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells expand also substantially horizontally in particular within layer 2/3 and 5 to contact surrounding cortical domains (“barrel”-related columns).
21451062	43	Neonatal neurons are notoriously sluggish in response to stimulation (Crain 1952; Purpura et al. 1965) because of immature excitatory synaptic input (Purpura et al. 1965) and immature expression of ion channels (Bahrey and Moody 2003; Huguenard et al. 1988).
10634900	64	Individual presynaptic action potentials were produced by injecting brief current pulses (3–5 ms, 0.8 –1 nA), and the unitary excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded from the postsynaptic cell under voltage-clamp mode (V = h -70 mV).

20927409	407	Briefly, short depolarizing voltage steps (0.2 ms, from Vh = 270 to 10 mV) were injected into the recorded cell, in order to elicit unclamped, presumed axonal action potentials, producing typical GABAergic synchronous responses.

17317752	203	For all comparisons between cell types, the probability of a type II error was lower than 0.01 for an effect size ≥ 3 ms, which indicates that average onset latencies of stimulus representation are very similar for layer 4 cells, L5 thick-tufted cells and L6 cells.

17698015	251	Consistent with this idea, recent data indicate that K+ channels at the soma and proximal dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons are largely DTX insensitive (Bekkers and Delaney, 2001; Guan et al., 2006) and present at densities significantly higher than previously thought (Schaefer et al., 2007).

19295167	251	Because at high firing rates both spiking behaviors exhibit a marked frequency adaptation (Kawaguchi, 1995), these cells were termed adapting Neuropeptide Y neurons.
9592109	212	Although the interpretation of these data is not entirely straightforward, this pattern of results could indicate a contribution from a subunit that is an order of magnitude smaller in spatial scale than the complex cell itself.
20720120	339	The spike-triggered average of V of the pyramidal cell (black line; n 94,221 events) is superimposed on the cross-correlogram.
19295167	83	A pronounced (7) first spike latency or delayed firing (Gupta et al., 2000; Ascoli et al., 2008), previously referred to as “late spiking” (Kawaguchi, 1995; Tama ́ s et al., 2003), has been reported to be a distinctive feature of neurons of the morphological neurogliaform class.
16793907	84	Slices containing biocytin-filled neurones were processed using a modified protocol previously described (Lu ̈ bke et al. 2000).
20550566	54	However, whisker sensory perception and its contribution to driving goal-directed behaviors do not arise solely from the activity of neurons located in S1, but rather result from interactions of neurons across multiple brain areas.
14602839	144	There is a progressive decrease in cell input resistance and in membrane time constant.
22593736	17	Current injection into the apical dendrites of layer 6 pyramidal neurons evokes spiking which is more irregular than during somatic current injection, the inter-spike interval being more variable during dendritic current injection (Ledergerber and Larkum, 2010).
9592109	124	The main lesson of this manipulation, therefore, was that complex-cell-like response did not require NMDA channel activation, assuming the presence in the dendrites of other excitatory voltage-dependent channels, even in cases where NMDA channels contributed strongly to the normal visually evoked responses of the cell.
10980023	342	Such reciprocal interactions may achieve synchrony only as a steady-state condition; this may explain why some Fast spiking cells recorded in the present study exhibited early (Fig. 11C) or late (Fig. 11D) spikes that were not aligned with the remainder of the response.
19474331	174	In addition to the developmental loss of spike-frequency adaptation, narrowing of action potentials, and concomitant emergence of high-frequency firing, we also found a massive and highly significant decrease in the input resistance of G42 cells over development.

15456817	366	Synaptic weights One neglected consideration in most circuit diagrams and their functional interpretation is the absolute number of cells of a particular type that contribute their synapses to a given projection.
17334362	188	This greatly decreased inhibitory suppression in the RS cell and increased suppression in the FS; the mixed postsynaptic potentials were now suppressed 48% (RS cell) and 61% (FS cell) relative to their respective pure EPSPs (Fig. 4e, Swap Ge and Gi kinetics).

18787231	313	The present study was aimed at an unbiased quantitative analysis of the low-dimensional relations between interneuron properties (i.e., between pairs, triplets or quadruplets of parameters).
9880578	137	These two distributions were not significantly different (Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test; p > 0.05) in the 12 pyramidal cells tested (Fig. 2C); therefore, the hypothesis of a non-uniform population of GABAergic synapses with distinct GABAA receptor subtypes activated in the presence of tetrodotoxin is not supported by our data.

19295167	577	This further indicates that adapting vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and bursting vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons share important similarities (see above).
15987765	346	For example, recent data from the hippocampus suggest that interneurons targeting distal dendrites are recruited by sustained activity (late persistent interneurons) and may have a modulatory role on the firing rate of pyramidal cells as opposed to a role in controlling the spike timing of pyramidal cells, which is provided by fast-spiking cells (Mittmann et al. 2004; Pouille and Scanziani 2004).

8459275	511	A. Electrophysiological properties of neocortical neurons in vitro.
9457640	30	Initial work Experiments were performed on 300 ,um thick, sagittal brain slices suggested that action potentials in spinal motoneurons are from somatosensory neocortex of P26-30 Wistar rats prepared as initiated in the axon initial segment (Eccles, 1964).
17898147	317	Here we reveal that corticothalamic, -trigeminal, and -striatal neurons have significantly different fast afterhyperpolarization and depolarizing afterpolarization amplitudes.
20927409	345	In anesthetized or awake animals fast-spiking cells have been reported to fire high-frequency trains of action potentials that reliably match cortical ripples (up to 200 Hz, .100 ms; e.g., Figure 43 of [68]) and very fast oscillations (400–600 Hz) induced by sensory stimulations [44,45].
9457640	238	The results show that the site of action potential initiation in these neurons is always in the axon, despite the fact that distal synaptic stimulation can initiate dendritic regenerative potentials prior to somatic action potentials.
19914188	101	For example, sparse firing of superficial Pyramidal cells could reflect either spatially localized or distributed activity (Figure 5A).
15525762	189	Paired-pulse ratios in IPSPs onto pyramidal cells (0.89 0.13; n 5) and cannabinoid receptor-1-expressing irregular-spiking cells (0.97 0.03; n 3) were not statistically different ( p 0.69).
9453672	75	Applications of horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent dyes directly on the pial surface were used to identify the source of neurons projecting to layer I of shown in C by retrograde transport.
11826166	325	The large differences in the mean amplitude of unitary EPSPs between different layer 4 connections may therefore be determined to a significant degree by differences in the functional properties of the projection and the target cell, rather than by differences in their morphology, as has been suggested previously for connections between L5 pyramidal cells and layer 4 spiny neurones (Markram et al. 1997; Feldmeyer et al. 1999a).
22002739	346	As subplate neurons grow, the number of dendritic segments increases from the third dendritic order, on the other hand, the pruning takes place from the fourth order (e).

15182718	68	The number of action potentials evoked in neurons by glutamate uncaging (“excitability”) depends on multiple factors, including the density of glutamate receptors, the capacity of glutamate clearance systems, the input impedance of neurons, the properties of voltage-gated conductances, etc.
21917809	151	In optimal cases, we could map the inputs onto four pyramidal cells in different focal planes (Fig. 3) For example, in the experiment shown, we tested the connectivity from 22 positive interneurons, assessing the connectivity status of a total of 88 pairs in this single slice.
19641119	310	Consequently, only pyramidal cells receiving strong excitatory inputs might be activated (Koch and Segev, 2000), resulting in a sparse coding of information in the prefrontal cortex during theta oscillations.

20720120	394	The low input impedance, coupled with large-amplitude thetaassociated Vm change in entorhinal cortex2 neurons compared with entorhinal cortex3 and entorhinal cortex5 cells, implies a strong theta-associated membrane current in stellate cells and hence several times larger contribution to the LFP theta than that of the other entorhinal cortex neurons.

21368112	27	Considering that slender- and thick-tufted neurons are primarily involved in processing of signals related to the phase of whisker motion and whisker touch, respectively, our anatomical quantification of their intracortical targets leads to a hypothesis on cell type-specific microcircuits that may encode active whisker motion, passive whisker touch, and object location.
15525762	3	We identified a population of cannabinoid receptor-1-expressing interneurons in layer II/III in mouse neocortical slices.
22798946	271	One study suggests that layer 2/3 pyramidal cells are more strongly connected to layer 5 pyramidal cells when they are located above barrel walls (Dodt et al., 2003).
12746859	274	As a result, the basal arbors of subgroup 1A were more compact in most cases, i.e., they could be enclosed by a circle centered at the cell body, as opposed to 1B where that part of the dendritic tree is skewed.

20927409	362	Similarly, in PGC-1a2\2 of residual Ca mice characterized by decreased parvalbumin levels in hippocampal interneurons, asynchronous release onto dentate gyrus granule cells during and after 40-Hz train stimulations (500 ms) was significantly larger than in wild-type animals [73].
9592109	209	White noise analysis has indicated that spatial modulation of nonlinear interactions in fact can occur on scales much smaller than the extent of a complex cell's receptive field, traveling along the preferred orientation axis.
20005597	208	Although it has been shown that in barrel cortex the number of neurons and dendrites are stable during the aging (Curcio and Coleman, 1982; Coleman et al., 1986), this process affects both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission, but in particular cortical circuits one or the other may be more strongly affected.
18787231	269	Data from 4 control pyramidal neurons is shown as triangles.
20927409	8	Since each fast-spiking cell contacts many P neurons, asynchronous release from a single interneuron may desynchronize a large portion of the local network and disrupt cortical information processing.
15737062	268	In a previous study of layer 5 pyramidal cells, we found only a weak—although statistically significant—dependence of the percentage amount of long-term potentiation on the pre-long-term potentiation excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude so that fractional synaptic change due to long-term potentiation was in effect approximately constant for most synaptic strengths [5].
21753015	5	These synaptic characteristics were strongly correlated to the projection subtype of the presynaptic neuron.
16701210	299	It is noteworthy that another contribution to the GABAergic synaptic contacts to distal apical dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons comes from Martinotti cells from layers 2–6 (Thomson and Bannister, 2003; Wang et al., 2004), whose activity is tightly regulated by other L5 pyramidal neurons establishing a disynaptic inhibitory feedback loop (Silberberg et al., 2004, Soc.

9453672	171	Likewise, we find that these cells project to layer I of shown in C with the use of fluorescent tracers but not with horseradish peroxidase (Clancy and Cauller, 1995).
2332787	15	One layer 5 cell, which had an apical trunk that bifurcated near the top of layer 4 and ascended as 2 parallel trunks through layer 2/3, could not be included in either of these classes and was not analyzed further.
22798946	242	Note that the apical tuft of the layer 2 pyramidal cell is substantially larger than the basal dendritic tree of that neuron while layer 3 pyramidal cells have slender apical tufts.
17334362	254	In fact, there is clear evidence that thalamocortical terminals tend to innervate the somata of interneurons more densely than the somata of excitatory neurons20,35–38; this is consistent with faster synaptic responses.

19295167	699	Similarly to fast-spiking-parvalbumin neurons, adapting somatostatin cells also form a network of electrically coupled interneurons (Gibson et al., 1999) whose rhythmic activity is synchronized by group I metabotropic glutamate agonists (Beierlein et al., 2000) through the activation of the mGluR1 receptors they express (Baude et al., 1993; Cauli et al., 2000).

17317752	27	Here we characterize in a larger sample of identified cells the suprathreshold action potential representation of single whisker deflections in different layers using juxtasomal recordings.
18466749	288	Moreover, modeling showed that specific localization to the axon was required for the ability of Kv1 channels to efficiently dampen fast-spiking cell excitability in the near-threshold range while at the same time leaving unaffected the suprathreshold high-frequency discharge that defines fast-spiking cells.
22002739	191	The passive membrane properties of subplate neurons change with age.
8459275	484	By these physiological properties and the horizontal extension of their dendrites across more than one column, high input-resistance cells should integrate inputs to layer V over wider temporal and spatial extents.

18466749	155	Many of these strongly Kv1.1-positive cells were also GFP positive in parvalbumin-GFP transgenic mice (Figure 4A; note that not all parvalbumin-positive cells are GFP positive in these mice, but all GFP-positive cells express parvalbumin).
8459275	461	Because fast-spiking cells are considered GABAergic cells, only certain layers are likely to be specifically suppressed at the same time, especially when the cells are strongly depolarized.
17717695	213	The intracortical connectivity of septal neurons has been omitted for simplicity.
12546824	91	Modeling GABAergic Excitation To better understand the spatiotemporal parameters that determine whether a given GABAergic event will be excitatory or inhibitory, we modeled IPSP-EPSP interactions in a multicompartmental model of a layer 5 pyramidal neuron.
22798946	486	In addition to these subcortical target regions, there are also direct projections of axons originating in somatosensory cortex back to the ipsilateral PrV and the contralateral SpV trigeminal nuclei (Welker et al., 1988; Jacquin et al., 1990; Aronoff et al., 2010) suggesting that neurons in these first relay stations of the whiskerto-cortex pathway are under a very direct feedback modulation of the somatosensory barrel cortex.

17122323	393	The ability of focal acetylcholine application to modulate cholecystokinin- and vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive non-fast-spiking neurons contrasts with its inability to modulate the excitability of parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking cells and somatostatin-positive non-fast-spiking neurons and suggests that transient acetylcholine release will preferentially facilitate certain inhibitory circuits, especially in the most superficial cortical layers.

19914188	44	The firing rates and tuning sharpness of putative Pyramidal cells did not differ significantly from those of morphologically identified Pyramidal cells of the corresponding layers (Figure S6); the tuning of putative interneurons, however, differed from that of Pyramidal cells, with superficial putative interneurons showing broader tuning, more similar to deep Pyramidal cells than to superficial Pyramidal cells.
17317752	214	This suggests that cells with high spontaneous activity might have membrane potentials close to action potential threshold, which result in shorter response latencies after a sensory stimulus.

17317752	366	The observation that action potential peaks in L2/3 and L5A are delayed with respect to the peaks in layer 4, L5 thick-tufted cells and L6 could either result from delayed activation of the paralemniscal pathway (Diamond et al. 1992b; Ahissar et al. 2000; Sosnik et al. 2001) or could mean that in these layers sequential input from layer 4 is more important for spiking (Brecht et al. 2003; Feldmeyer et al. 2005; Schubert et al. 2006).

17334362	27	In principle, the greater propensity of FS cells to spike in response to thalamic stimulation could have been due to differences in intrinsic membrane properties, synaptic mechanisms or both.
20550566	284	The recent development of optogenetic tools (Nagel et al., 2003; Boyden et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2007) combined with new viral tools and the increasing number of cell-type-specific genetically engineered mice (Aronoff & Petersen, 2006; Gong et al., 2007; Livet et al., 2007; Wickersham et al., 2007a&,b; Luo et al., 2008; Cardin et al., 2009; O'Connor et al., 2009; Sohal et al., 2009) is likely to help significant progress be made over the coming decades into the causal analysis of which neurons in the brain serve which functions during whisker behaviors.

19474331	286	Previous studies have assayed whole-transcriptome expression in rodent neocortex over similar periods of maturation (Semeralul et al., 2006; Stead et al., 2006; Lyckman et al., 2008), but ours is the first to restrict such analysis to a homogeneous subclass of interneurons.

14673000	116	Local dendritic spikes were never observed in isolation and were always followed with a short delay by action potentials detected at the somatic recording site, suggesting that dendritic spikes in prefrontal pyramidal neurons can propagate to the soma and have a direct impact on axonal action potential initiation.
20720120	172	The dendrites of the reconstructed neuron (entorhinal cortex5-609202) presented the features of a classical pyramidalshaped entorhinal cortex5 neuron.
15456817	314	Using a lower proportion of layer 4 basket cells (i.e., 40%), we get similar synapse numbers (248 synapses onto spiny neurons and 178 synapses onto smooth neurons).
21451062	260	We previously reported negligible effects of 0.1 Cd2 on the persistent components of the K current in these cells (Guan et al. 2007b); however, Cd2 has been shown to shift the voltage dependence and kinetics of Kv currents (especially Kv4 mediated; Davidson and Kehl 1995; Follmer et al. 1992; Guan et al. 2007b; Wickenden et al. 1999).
21917809	91	In coronal brain slices, we targeted and recorded from 91 GFP-positive cells (69 in somatosensory cortex layer 2/3, 15 in somatosensory cortex layer 5, and 7 in frontal cortex layer 2/3), and performed anatomical and electrophysiological characterizations of these neurons.
22514308	517	Importantly, the peak Vm depolarization of the cell and the corresponding dF/F signal were similar to the control conditions in travel trials (Fig. 11 A, right column).
22514308	568	In layer 5 and, although regular spiking cells receive inhibition from multiple sources, intrinsically bursting cells receive relatively few inhibitory inputs (Schubert et al., 2001).
20720120	364	The divergent– convergent entorhinal cortex2–entorhinal cortex3–entorhinal cortex2 recurrent loop may be instrumental in segregating neurons both spatially and temporally.
22002739	298	We only measured and analyzed the somatodendritic features of the subplate neurons in the rest of the study.

9007187	872	Afferents from the basolateral amygdala terminate principally in these layers (Kita and Kitai, 1990; Bacon et al., 1996) and specific sets of pyramidal neurons in layer 2 and deep layer 5 project to the ipsilateral amygdala and to the contralateral medial prefrontal cortex (Cassell et al., 1989).

17317752	347	In turn, spontaneous APs emitted by L5A cells could, because of L5A-to-L1 axonal projections, continuously depolarize the apical tuft dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells, thereby favouring the generation of bursts of APs (Larkum & Zhu, 2002; Larsen & Callaway, 2006).
9457640	167	Note back-propagation of somatic action potentials was still observed in those cells where the dendrites initiated regenerative events prior to somatic action potentials, despite the fact that the depolarization associated with dendritic regenerative events might have been expected to inactivate dendritic sodium channels, reducing the ability of action potentials to propagate back into the dendrites.

16369481	175	Together, these results indicate that cell type, rather than genetic background, is the major determinant of these expression profiles.

9570781	139	An overlay of the predicted response with the experimental data during long somatic current pulses for the cell depicted in Figure 1 A is shown in Figure 2 B.
19295167	541	However, in contrast with adapting vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons, bursting vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons exhibited smaller and rounder somata that could not generally be categorized as fusiform (Table 2).
15456817	178	For each layer, we estimated the proportion of neurons of a given cell type and, therefore, the absolute cell numbers as well.
16369481	131	This supports the idea that duplicated genes contribute to the diversification of cell types.
17317752	154	Note that action potential responses are layer-specific and that the slender-tufted cell has the longest latency to spiking.
15101088	133	Thus, three data points (at 90%, 100%, and 110%) were plotted for each neuron to calculate the f-I slope (or gain) and intercept (shift) by linear regression.
21286222	13	A subset of pyramidal neurons fire discrete clusters of 2–6 action potentials at regular intervals during constant current injection (Connors et al., 1982; McCormick et al., 1985; Agmon and Connors, 1989; Chagnac-Amitai et al., 1990; Mason and Larkman, 1990).
12746859	182	This measure is similar to the circularity index; however, it helps to detect minute differences in cell contour; for example, roundness helps to distinguish pyramidal/conical somata from round or triangular ones, whereas the circularity index distinguishes circular or oval-shaped somata from irregularly shaped ones.
15987765	350	The slope of the adaptation ratio for neurogliaform cells was several times more negative than this measurement in vertically oriented interneurons.
19295167	451	layers were categorized as (1) spiny stellate cells.
19295167	555	In good agreement with previous reports (Cauli et al., 1997; Porter et al., 1998), both adapting vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and bursting vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons displayed the lowest and the most polarized number of primary dendrites, which formed a slender vertical dendritic tree (Fig. 1 B, a7, a8; Table 8) spanning at least layers I–IV (some of them reaching layer Vb or VI).

9007187	188	The percentage of diaphorase-reactive neurones in the immunoreacted zones of the material that were immunolabelled for a given calcium-binding protein or for g-aminobutyric acid was also determined.
11731554	313	These data taken together with the observation that the former also could not be distinguished from spontaneously occurring EPSCs recorded in the same neurons suggests that synaptic AMPARs on layer V pyramidal neurons are functionally similar.

21753015	344	These results support the idea that the synaptic temporal characteristics are strongly influenced by the presynaptic pyramidal cell subtype, even among connections with similar release probabilities.

19295167	294	The adapting Neuropeptide Y cluster contained pronounced amplitude accommodation (Fig. 4 A, C; Table 6), the largest proportion of Neuropeptide Y-expressing neurons (n 29 of two physiological behaviors also observed in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing 38) (Figs.

21917809	197	Given that this result was obtained with a new mapping method, we sought to confirm the high local connectivity with dual whole-cell recordings in nonoptical experiments by recording from randomly selected pairs of positive interneurons and pyramidal cells whose cell bodies were within 160 m each other (Fig. 5A).
12695107	65	We have developed an automated system to reconstruct neurons in three dimensions from laser scanning microscopy images, which is capable of resolving both gross tree topology as well as fine structural detail in dendrites and spines.
15987765	271	Both the latter and the other six interneurons with mixed firing pattern still fell in the intermediate-spiking cells cluster, despite their adaptation ratio characteristic for fast-spiking cells.

16467534	235	These developmental differences in AP conduction will require additional investigation and are likely to reflect differences in axonal sodium channel expression and localization before myelination as has recently been shown in retinal ganglion cell axons (Boiko et al., 2001).
15044524	13	Physiologically, nonpyramidal cells can be divided into several groups by their firing characteristics (Kawaguchi, 1993, 1995, 2001; Thomson et al., 1996; Cauli et al., 1997, 2000; Gupta et al., 2000).
17898147	257	The adaptation ratios (P 0.001) and firingcurrent slopes (P 0.05) of corticothalamic and -trigeminal neurons as well as the firing threshold (P 0.001) of corticothalamic neurons remained significantly different from those of callosal and corticostriatal neurons (Scheffe post hoc comparison).
17717695	220	The intracortical connectivity of septal neurons has been omitted for simplicity.
11731554	52	Interestingly, however, while the functional properties of AMPARs were common among synaptic inputs onto the neuron, the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors displayed input-specific differences in their activation.
20720120	365	In contrast, entorhinal cortex5 pyramidal cells would influence only very few superficial neurons directly, indicating a strongly asymmetric divergent– convergent communication between entorhinal cortex2 and entorhinal cortex5 principal cells.
8459275	393	Dendritic fields in deep layers were thus wider for the high input-resistance cells than those of the low input-resistance cells.
19805321	129	However, because sister cells comprise only a small fraction of all pairs forming the considered projections, their influence on our results is negligible.
22232599	205	Importantly, these changes in the efficacy of aerobic metabolism occurred in the range of basal pO2 (>150 Torr) considerably exceeding the physiological pO2 levels in vivo (20–40 Torr; Erecinska and Silver, 2001; Masamoto et al., 2003, 2007; Takano et al., 2007), suggesting divergent oxygen requirements of neurons in slices.
15456817	215	One example is the layer 5 pyramidal cells of which the axons innervating layer 2/3 and layer 5 at approximately equal proportions also do exist (Martin and Whitteridge, 1984).
16267239	243	In five of six neurons that experienced subthreshold depolarization in carbachol, additional muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation with focally applied Acetylcholine generated transient hyperpolarizing responses (Fig. 8 A).
19295167	547	The Ward subdivision of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons in two clusters is presumably reflected by electrophysiological features affected by the high firing rate that occurs in bursts of action potentials.
16369481	308	To establish intrinsic electrophysiological properties, each cell was subjected to a series of 1-s long current pulses of varying amplitude.

17317752	108	Accordingly, cells were categorized either as L5 slender-tufted cells or L5 thick-tufted cells (n = 16 for both cell types).
15456817	174	Number of neurons per cell type There are no direct measurements of the frequency of occurrence of many cell types.

9592109	199	Furthermore, the demonstration of subunit-based orientation tuning when either 100 or 1024 LGN cells provided direct input to the cortical cell suggests that the relevant cooperative synaptic interactions can operate under a wide range of synaptic activation densities.

16793907	136	Within a barrel column there was no correlation between the EPSP amplitude and the distance between the pre- and postsynaptic layer 2/3 pyramidal cell bodies.
9592109	197	The control runs of Figure 5 further demonstrate that pyramidal cell dendrites are extremely accommodating with respect to the intradendritic operations under study here.
15456817	375	Of course, likely sources are known (e.g., smooth neurons were not recovered in all laminas in our recordings, and this accounts for the large percentages of unassigned symmetric synapses in those layers).
2332787	116	No boundary between layers 2 and 3 could be discerned histologically, but if an arbitrary division was placed at half the depth of 2/3, the sample consisted of 6 layer 2 cells and I2 from layer 3.
15987765	253	In this regard, local, medium, wide arbor, and chandelier cells were very homogeneous even across substantially different morphologies such as wide arbor cells and chandelier interneurons (Table 3).
17122323	59	However, subsequent data from the same laboratory found no evidence that transient mAChR activation excites interneurons in the rat neocortex (Xiang et al. 1998).

15525762	260	A, Paired recording 1 from two electrically coupled CB -irregular spiking cells.
22798946	442	In consequence, this coordinated modulation of layer 2/3 and layer 5 neurons may result in the lateral expansion of the activity of the principal barrel-related column.
17898147	339	Although the pipettes containing retrograde tracers used in our study were targeted to the dorsolateral striatum, tracer deposits in this narrow region containing collaterals of corticothalamic neurons were likely only a fraction of the total injected volume.
22002739	108	Under the microscope, subplate neurons underneath the barrel pattern can be visualized and approached (Fig. 1b).
18466749	326	Kv1 channels in fast-spiking cell axons are precisely localized to the ankyrincontaining domain and hence presumably overlap exactly with the region of Na+ channel localization (Figure 4).
15737062	211	Such neurons may be analogous to "network hubs," or nodes with particularly large numbers of connections (degrees), which are known to exist in other networks [22,38].
9457640	309	Thus the axon is the final site where synaptic integration takes place, providing neurons with a single site where synaptic inhibition will be most effective.
15737062	452	(E) Mean synaptic connection is uniform with regard to the depth of both the neuron sending the connection and the neuron receiving the connection ( p = 0.2, one-way ANOVA).
17317752	383	More specifically, spiny stellates would relay sensory information exclusively within the column by means of their almost exclusively columnar axonal arbors, whereas pyramidal neurones are involved in transcolumnar processing via horizontal collaterals (Staiger et al. 2004).
9236245	60	The class of CT cells is subdivided according to the projection site of the axons in the thalamus, and corticocortical cells are grouped according to the morphology of their dendritic trees.

19641119	8	During prefrontal spindle oscillations, the majority of pyramidal cells and parvalbumin /calbindin basket cells fired preferentially at the trough and early ascending phase, but calbindin /parvalbumin dendrite-targeting cells fired uniformly at all phases.
10980023	182	D: stable impalements were obtained in 58 Regular spiking cells, 5 intrinsic bursting cells, and 4 Fast spiking cells.
17898147	43	Physiologically, two major classes of pyramidal cells have been described in layer V based on differences in their intrinsic firing properties: intrinsically bursting cells, which fire bursts of action potentials in response to depolarizing current injection, and regular spiking cells, which fire trains of single action potentials (Connors et al. 1982; McCormick et al. 1985).
19759293	7	Introduction The expression of ligand-gated ion channels on axons near presynaptic sites of release provides a direct signaling pathway to locally modulate the strength of synaptic transmission between neurons independent of the somatodendritic compartment (MacDermott et al., 1999; Engelman and MacDermott, 2004).
8574660	67	In adapting regular spiking neurons neurons, the action potentials are followed by a pure afterhyperpolarizing potential (see magnification of the 4th action potential (v) in inset Kz), whereas in non-adapting neurons the action potentials are followed by a more complex after potential (inset B~) consisting of a more or less evident fast afterhyperpolarizing potential (small arrow), followed by a small DAP (large arrow).
22593736	163	These effects are similar to the changes in intrinsic membrane properties we reported for layer 5 pyramidal neurons (Hedrick and Waters, 2011).

20550566	234	Neurons in the caudate–putamen interact with the more medially located neurons in the globus pallidus.
17122323	413	Therefore it is unlikely that the larger amplitude responses in prefrontal neurons reflect a qualitative difference in cholinergic modulation of the cortex.
15115747	20	The underlying computational unit for gain modulation can be realized at the network or single-cell level.
19914188	306	Note that to reduce the risk of misclassification (such as might arise from somatodendritic backpropagation of action potentials in large pyramidal cells; Buzsaki and Kandel, 1998), this criterion was deliberately conservative, with cells of intermediate depth or deeper than putative layers not assigned to either group for further analysis.

21917809	37	Our results support the view that the dense architecture of interneuron connectivity, whereby a “blanket of inhibition” is extended on local pyramidal cells, is a universal or canonical feature in the design of neocortical microcircuits.
18305253	133	To confirm that the NMDA receptors that modulate release at layer 4 – layer 2/3 synapses were non-postsynaptic, we recorded isolated AMPA-EPSCs with internal iMK-801 iMK-801, no TBOA the postsynaptic cell (1 mM) to block postsynaptic NMDA receptors (see Materials and Methods).

21368112	427	(B) On the population level, spiking activity during active whisker motion does not display any significant differences between slender- and thick-tufted neurons and is similar to spontaneous spiking during anesthesia or nonwhisking periods (note that significant differences between nonwhisking and whisking periods can be observed for individual recordings, preferentially in L5A).
21753015	277	Thus, reciprocally connected corticopontine cells/corticopontine cells pairs included From these results, axonal morphologies of Layer 5 pyramidal neularge-amplitude EPSCs, but only in one direction, suggesting rons depend not only on the projection subtype, but also on the their unbalanced synaptic relation.

15539396	363	In pyramidal neurones of the CA1 region of the hippocampus an A-type K+ conductance is responsible for the modulation of b-action potential amplitude (Hoffman et al. 1997).
19295167	245	At high firing rates, these cells also displayed a marked frequency adaptation characteristic of adapting (n 16) and burst firing (n 1) neurons and were therefore termed adapting somatostatin neurons.
20927409	389	Asynchronous autaptic and synaptic release, induced by abrupt high-frequency firing of fast-spiking interneurons, reduces spike precision and reliability of cortical neurons and therefore might change the network coding strategy to propagate information from precise spike timing (such as during oscillations) to average spike rates (such as during cortical nonsynchronized states).
17698015	7	Cell-attached recordings revealed a 10-fold increase in Kv1 channel density over the first 50 mm of the axon initial segment.
9453672	15	The major targets of these afferents are the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells whose somata lie in deeper layers, from II to V. Layer I is about 0.15 mm thick, consists of virtually all neuropil, and has a density of presumed excitatory synapses that is among the highest in the cortex (Jones and Powell, 1970; Adinolfi, 1972; Vaughan and Peters, 1973; Beaulieu and Colonnier, 1985; Braitenberg and Schu ̈ z, 1991).
10980023	144	The response of these cells to depolarizing current injection exhibited a wide dynamic range and little or no spike frequency adaptation, with strong stimulation evoking a sustained firing rate in excess of 500 Hz.
16467534	262	Together, these anatomical features would be expected to “push” the site of AP initiation further down the axon in cerebellar Purkinje neurons.
21286222	144	In this neuron the decline in temperature was accompanied by depolarization of the resting membrane potential from −65 to −57 mV.
12456830	312	The very much smaller rate of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents as seen in bipolar cells might allow interneurones to exert their crucial role in synchronising networks (Traub et al. 1996).

10980023	321	multi-unit activity was phase-locked to fast oscillations, which indicates that the rapid synaptic currents reflected in field potential recordings control the timing of action potential generation in populations of pyramidal cells with a precision in the millisecond range.
15456817	413	Thus, whether the synapse is formed specifically on a spine cell types therefore consists of a few anatomically strong projecor dendritic shaft does not affect our calculation.

17317752	373	Surprisingly, most of these differences were not observed in whole-cell recordings (Manns et al. 2004).
15539396	40	Due to the high resistance of the electrodes used for dendritic recordings (15–20 M ), the whole-cell configuration was established using hyperpolarizing current steps instead of suction pulses.
12456830	263	In vivo recordings also show that neurones in intact tissue can be in two different states: in a hyperpolarised or a depolarised state (Steriade et al. 2001; Brecht & Sakmann, 2002).
9007187	652	The cortical depth distribution of g-aminobutyric acid+ neurones reflected the combined cortical depth distributions for calretinin-, Parvalbumin- and calbindin D-28k-immunolabelled cells (Fig. 17).
16793907	275	Within this round to oval innervation domain, the layer 2/3 axonal length was 2881 μm (barrel-centred); with a bouton density of 0.30 ± 0.02 μm-1, this corresponds to roughly 900 synaptic boutons per pyramidal cell in the innervation domain.

15737062	303	To ensure that arborizations of recorded L5 neurons were minimally damaged during dissection, slices were used only if L5 apical dendrites were approximately parallel with the slice surface and could be traced most or all of the way to the pial surface.
15456817	380	Nevertheless, our results indicate how essential it is to obtain a more complete quantitative account of the smooth neuron population in the cat.
20550566	235	The pallidal neurons in turn influence the thalamus, which of course interacts strongly with cortex, thus completing a long subcortical loop back to the neocortex.

8459275	434	A small population of pyramidal cells (intrinsically bursting cells) generate a burst of at least three action potentials in a stereotyped pattern arising from a slow membrane depolarization.
14602839	274	A recent study has shown that about 30% of pyramidal neurons in the adult rat prefrontal cortex are intrinsically bursting cells (Degenetais et al. 2002).
9007187	609	These cells were not oriented uniformly within the cortex.
22798946	425	Excitatory neurons in sublamina 6B of the barrel cortex have very heterogeneous dendritic morphologies, ranging from short, untufted pyramids with apical dendrites that terminate in layer 5, those with atypically oriented (oblique, horizontal or inverted) “apical” dendrites to multipolar neurons without a clear apical dendrite (Andjelic et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009).

10884314	43	For subsequent morphological analysis, 2–5 mg/ml biocytin (Sigma, Mu ̈nchen, Germany) was routinely added to the internal solution, and neurons were filled during 1–3 hr of recording.
21286222	62	During large current injections the strongly bursting neurons began with an initial burst of 2–4 spikes which was followed with regular spiking.
19805321	119	Second, we proposed a cooperative model of synapse formation, which led to a good agreement with the experimentally observed distributions of synapse numbers and the probabilities of finding synaptically coupled pairs of neurons.
22798946	413	In contrast to corticothalamic L6A pyramidal neurons, the axons of corticocortical L6A pyramidal cells remain mainly within layer 5 and 6 of the somatosensory cortex (Figure 7A, right neuron; Zhang and Deschênes, 1997).
18466749	68	Delayed firing by fast-spiking cells was not simply due to the passive charging of the fast-spiking cell membrane, as these cells were found to have a fast membrane time constant of 5.7 ± 1.1 ms (range, 3.9–9.1 ms; n = 23).
12514205	285	The high degree of electrical coupling among late-spiking cells that we demonstrate here suggests that these cells may be able to synchronize their activity and thus exert powerful control at their postsynaptic targets.
9592109	123	However, the degree of response suppression seen in tuned cells under NMDA block in our simulations could be controlled over a wide range by varying the initial (preblock) conductances of NMDA channels in the dendrites.

15987765	141	Typically, fast-spiking neurons had input resistances that were slightly higher than those in regular-spiking populations cells, but the membrane time constant in fast-spiking cells was lower than that in the former (Fig. 2, C and D).
12037194	342	Information concerning whisker movement from the thalamus is relayed to barrel cortex neurons primarily in layer 4, which respond to whisker deflections with shorter latency and more action potentials than neurons in the other layers.

19295167	241	Cluster 2.2 neurons exhibited indeed different firing behaviors: continuous adapting (n 95), bursting (n 17), and delayed (n 8) and different morphologies (Fig. 1 B).

17717695	3	They receive input from other cortical areas and subcortical brain regions and in turn their neurons provide output to various areas of the brain.
16467534	127	We observed two distinct components of the temporal derivative of the somatic AP in all layer 5 pyramidal neurons regardless of the axonal length (Fig. 4 B).
15539396	17	Given that back-propagating APs mediate feedback between neurone outputs and its synaptic inputs, modulation of the shape of back-propagating APs may have a direct effect on synaptic input.
17698015	69	Comparison of peak K+ current in cell-attached recordings obtained sequentially at identical axonal sites indicated that inclusion of 100–200 nM dendrotoxin-I in the pipette solution reduced axonal K+ current by on average 79% ± 7% (Figure 2B; p < 0.05, n = 4).
22798946	804	Layer- and cell-type-specific suprathreshold stimulus representation in rat primary somatosensory cortex.
16267239	22	Because responses were found to be sensitive to classical inhibitors of synaptic transmission [low external Ca 2 or tetrodotoxin] and to blockers of GABAA channels (picrotoxin or bicuculline), the inhibitory actions of Acetylcholine were attributed to increased GABA transmission after muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated excitation of interneurons (McCormick and Prince, 1985, 1986).

9236245	150	In general, the local collaterals of all types of corticocortical cells are studded with varicosities and pedunculated boutons, except the main branches, which remain smooth as they travel toward their distant projection site.
21917809	140	In other words, we never observed any false negatives in which a positive interneuron that did not appear to be connected optically was in fact connected.
11588205	4	Using a novel antibody directed against rat SK1, it has been determined that the rat SK1 channel is primarily in the soma of hippocampal CA1 neurons.
19295167	685	A small number of individual cells are assigned to different clusters by the two methods, but matching clusters continue to share similar average features, thus corresponding to completely equivalent polythetic classifications.
22114282	192	Thus, layer 5 contains two morphologically distinct subpopulations of output pyramidal neurons that differ in terms of their suprathreshold binocularity.
19295167	548	Indeed, bursting behavior was defined by high frequency at the onset of firing, followed by a strong adaptation (Ascoli et al., 2008); this results in higher minimal steady-state frequency and a more pronounced adaptation in bursting vasoactive intestinal polypeptide than in adapting vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons (Fig. 6C; Table 5).

18305253	110	For layer 4 current-clamp recordings, series resistance was measured by manual compensation using the whole-cell amplifier; the initial series resistance was 18.8 7.7 M (SD), and when measured again at the end of the experiment (35–55 magnitude effect, indi- Time later) it had increased by 0.8 1.8 M (SD).

19474331	326	Narrow integration windows and high-frequency non-adapting firing allow mature fast-spiking cells to exert strong temporal control over the activity of their synaptic targets (Holmgren et al., 2003; Galarreta et al., 2004).
18305253	320	We found that D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid treatment caused CV 2 to decrease miniature EPSCs iMK-801, no TBOA layer 2/3 pyramidal cells as above, and after a 10 magnitude effect, indi- Time significantly more than mean EPSC amplitude (Fig. 7D) baseline period, applied 20 M homoquinolinic acid for 10 magnitude effect, indi- Time.

9236245	217	It comes as a surprise that 44% of lamina V I cells of the cortical barrel field project to the second somatosensory area or to motor cortical regions.
22798946	316	At least a subset of the short layer 5 pyramidal cell has axonal projections via the corpus callosum to the contralateral (somatosensory) cortex (Larsen et al., 2007; Le Bé et al., 2007) like the short layer 5 pyramids in visual and auditory cortex (e.g., Games and Winer, 1988; Hübener and Bolz, 1988; Hübener et al., 1990; Koester and O'Leary, 1992).
17317752	81	Therefore, we used the non-parametric ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis test) for comparison of all cell types, followed by Dunn's post hoc test for comparison of two individual cell classifications.
3011189	89	In a, the Vm is depolarized t o - 6 8 mV by an outward steady current while in b the neuron is at resting Vm (-75 mV).
19641119	289	calbindin /parvalbumin dendrite-targeting cells fired Dendrite-tageting.
14602839	227	A third possibility is that the higher ratio of cell input resistance to the seal resistance in neonatal neurons causes significant error in V measurement.
17334362	228	Furthermore, the very low input resistances of FS interneurons tended to decrease, rather than increase, their excitability.
16701210	9	Inputs to this region of the cell have a negligible effect on the membrane potential (Vm) in the soma and initial segment of the axon because of the huge attenuation of subthreshold signals propagating along the apical dendrite (Stuart and Spruston, 1998).
19759293	114	A, Image of an layer 5 pyramidal cell dendrites before and following axonal patched and filled with Alexa 594 via an axon bleb.
19641119	330	In addition, during ongoing hippocampal theta oscillations under anesthesia, pyramidal cells in the dorsal CA1 area fire preferentially around the trough of the theta cycle (Klausberger et al., 2003), whereas prefrontal neurons fired most at the peak, which is not consistent with a monosynaptic activation.
17717695	126	Activity with delay to onset times < 5 ms is restricted to fields containing dendrites of the recorded neuron and represents direct responses.
22798946	428	For somatosensory barrel cortex it has been shown that—like L5B pyramids (see above)—L6B neurons located in both barrel and non-barrel (i.e., septal) cortex innervate posteromedial (Killackey and Sherman, 2003).
8459275	265	In fast-spiking cells two types of innervation patterns were observed.
22593736	224	The spiking pattern of the neuron remained constant.
21451062	402	Unlike neocortical pyramidal cells, CA1 pyramidal cells and medium spiny cells exhibited a reduction in the ratio of A-type current to the persistent current with age (Spiegelman et al. 1992; Surmeier et al. 1991) that was associated with expression of a novel slowly inactivating current component after the first postnatal week (Surmeier et al. 1991).
22593736	244	This hypothesis resulted from two observations: (1) the input resistance of layer 5 pyramidal neurons increases with decreasing temperature; and (2) layer 5 pyramidal neurons adopt regular spiking patterns at physiological temperatures and burst at lower temperatures.
17478724	198	Those axons had multiple synaptic terminal-like boutons, apposed by GAD-positive terminals surrounding neurons lacking GAD inside their soma (fig.
18466749	135	Interestingly, even after dendrotoxin-I application, there remained a discontinuity in the I-f relation (Figure S5), suggesting that the type-2 behavior of fast-spiking cells does not require the Kv1 current.
9007187	686	From these cortical depth distributions it was possible to calculate the percentage distribution of each cell type within given cortical layers (percentage; Tables 5–7).
16701210	148	The external medium was then supplemented with a "cocktail" for isolating Ca2+ currents containing the blockers tetrodotoxin (1 mM), tetraethylammonium-chloride (30 mM), and 4-action potential (5 mM), and in three cells, Ba2+ (200 mM) was added.
17898147	293	They are therefore likely to be Intratelencephalic-type-type corticostriatal neurons.
9592109	12	Orientation tuning in simple cells is now widely considered to derive from a combination of influences, specifically a weak orientation bias in the input from LGN, modulated by feedback inhibition and excitation from other cortical neurons (Ferster et al., 1996; Vidyasagar et al., 1996; Somers et al., 1995; Krukowski et al., 1996).
17478724	52	In the mammalian brain, neurons integrate synaptic inputs onto their somatodendritic domains, which control the generation of action potentials propagating through the axonal arbor to axon terminals, at which signals are transmitted to postsynaptic neurons.
14602839	33	Between P3 and P21, the surface area of the cell body doubled, while the total lengths of apical and basal dendrites increased by 5- and 13-fold, respectively.
21368112	86	We found that axon branches of thick-tufted neurons were shorter and less complex than those of slender-tufted neurons, with total length ranging from 11.4 mm to 46.5 mm (31.6 ± 14.3 mm; P < 0.0001, t test; Fig.
8459275	363	Both components were not significantly different in time-to-peak and amplitude among the two groups of pyramidal cells (Table 2).
18216227	162	Thus the mean three-dimensional distance between each APevoking pixel and the center of the soma was 44 4 m and this distance was almost independent of the depth of the cell (r 0.21, Fig.
15772358	121	Thus, according to the direction sensitivity index measure, the spike output of the cell was more sensitive to direction than the underlying synaptic response amplitude.
16793907	460	Monosynaptic connections between pairs of spiny stellate cells in layer 4 and pyramidal cells in layer 5A indicate that lemniscal and paralemniscal afferent pathways converge in the infragranular somatosensory cortex.
15456817	70	An example is the chandelier cells that form synapses with pyramidal cells only.
17898147	215	Some studies have reported a difference in cell size between corticotectal and callosal neurons in the visual cortex (Hallman et al. 1988), whereas others do not (Hubener and Bolz 1988).
18216227	334	Using three-dimensional mapping by two-photon macro photolysis of caged glutamate”, however, we have found that it is difficult to identify presynaptic neurons from the locations of the EPSC-evoking pixels because two-photon macro photolysis of caged glutamate” presumably induced APs not only in a particular cell, but also in about 4 neighboring cells.
18971461	279	In addition, to calculate the common input probability, we adopted cell pairs, respectively in which we detected synchronous EPSCs during the recordings.
11731554	410	The ontogeny of the distribution of callosal projection neurons in the rat parietal cortex.
16793907	26	The borders of the lateral spread of excitation within and across the barrel column corresponding to the stimulated whisker hair – the principal whisker column – over the cortical surface are predominantly determined by the spread of axonal arbours of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in supragranular layers (Brecht et al. 2003; Petersen et al. 2003).
19914188	157	Common to both types of activity was a laminar and cell-type-dependent variation in sparseness, with sparse spatially clustered activity in Pyramidal cells of superficial layers and distributed dense activity in the deep layers, with densest firing in large L5tPCs and putative interneurons.
10980023	241	granular lamina exhibited response rhythmicity compared with the proportion of cells in the infragranular layer.
16467534	68	In experiments in which neurons had axons of varying length (21–968 m), neurons were selected at random, and the length of axon was determined at the end of the experiments after loading with a fluorescent dye (10 m Alexa Fluor 568) via the somatic recording pipette using a confocal microscope (FV300, Olympus; or LSM 510, Zeiss).
10980023	142	Action potentials in intrinsic bursting cells were otherwise indistinguishable from those of Regular spiking cells and, in some instances, injection of strong levels of depolarizing current often evoked a constant firing pattern similar to that of an Regular spiking cell.
20550566	159	Retrogradely labelled cells were obvious in somatosensory, indicating that S1 and somatosensory are reciprocally connected.
18216227	258	Mapping of local excitatory circuits innervating layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons.
17898147	89	To calculate the initial slope of the firingcurrent relationship, we analyzed responses of cells to threshold currents for generating action potentials and responses to two times the threshold current.
19474331	153	We therefore characterized G42 electrophysiological maturation by performing whole-cell current-clamp recordings in the presence of synaptic blockers from identified G42 cells in acute cortical slices containing primary motor cortex and S1 at postnatal day 7, postnatal day 10, P15, and P25.
15987765	227	The cluster of regular-spiking populations cells contained 70% pyramidal, 15% neurogliaform, 9% vertically oriented, and 6% arbor cells.
17898147	135	G: number of double-labeled neurons with both callosal and striatal projections were plotted as a percent of total callosal and corticostriatal neurons.
19805321	125	Positive spatial correlations had been observed between axons of inhibitory neurons and their postsynaptic targets, but not for the general population of excitatory cells (16).
10634900	130	In vivo experiments have revealed that burst activity in neocortical neurons is associated with sensory stimuli (Bair et al. 1994; Cattaneo et al. 1981; Livingstone et al. 1996), suggesting that brief periods of very rapid firing might play a role in encoding information (Lisman 1997).
17898147	252	These results indicate that the corticothalamic and -trigeminal neurons in layer Vb have characteristic firing properties that are significantly different from the callosal and corticostriatal neurons found primarily in layer Va.
19914188	177	Finally, while both studies reported denser activity in narrow-spiking putative interneurons than putative Pyramidal cells, their depth analysis was based on the full population of morphologically unreconstructed neurons, suggesting that the lack of reported depth tuning might result from the inclusion of densely firing superficial interneurons, in addition to sparsely firing superficial Pyramidal cells.
20927409	163	Our results instead indicate that the increase in spontaneous release originates from the terminals of the stimulated fast-spiking cell itself and that this change affects both autaptic and postsynaptic targets of the cell.

19914188	11	Pyramidal cells—the principal neurons of the neocortex—show strong heterogeneity in morphology, physiology, and gene expression patterns both between and within layers (Douglas and Martin, 2004; Gilbert, 1983; Nelson et al., 2006; Szentagothai, 1983; Thomson and Lamy, 2007).
22593736	92	At 24–26◦C, one neuron displayed a regular spiking pattern and the other nine were adapting (Figure 2A).
15101088	66	Excluding these cells, 44 of the remaining 125 neurons (35%) were from females and 81 (65%) from males.
17267749	205	Connections that showed long-term depression had total mean spike widths of 3.8 0.2-ms presynaptic neuron and 3.8 0.2-ms postsynaptic neuron.
8574660	7	The morphology, connectivity and physiological properties of adapting and non-adapting regular spiking neurons neurons are particularly suited to the processing of respectively phasic and tonic inputs, whereas the properties of in bursting neurons are consistent with their suggested role in cortical rhythmogenesis and in the pathophysiological synchronized activities underlying epileptogenesis.

20720120	199	In contrast, during theta oscillations, the membrane voltage distribution was unimodal in all neurons but the magnitude of theta-related voltage fluctuation was significantly larger in entorhinal cortex2 stellate neurons than in entorhinal cortex3 and entorhinal cortex5 pyramidal cells ( p 0.002) (Fig. 5).
12695107	273	7A and D, this method produces an excellent-quality result at low computational cost.

22798946	128	Thus, layer 4 is the major and dominant input layer in a barrel-related column in which the bouton density of ventral posterior medial nucleus axons is higher than in any other cortical L5A and L5B pyramidal neurons; most of theset boutons form synapses with layer 4 spiny stellate cells and star pyramidal neurons (Bruno and Sakmann, 2006; Oberlaender et al., 2011b).
9592109	202	LGN versus simple-cell subunit structure It is worthwhile to consider the relatively subtle differences in the nonlinear receptive field structure afforded to a complex cell by simple-cell-like subunits versus center-surround LGN subunits.

17522314	239	In contrast to the electrolytic and excitatory amino acid-induced lesions (Hohmann and Coyle, 1988), with an inherent lack of selectivity, the immunolesion technique using 192 IgG-saporin leads to exclusive destruction of the cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain (Wiley et al., 1991; Book et al., 1992; Robertson et al., 1998; Pappas and Sherren, 2003).
18971461	2	We classified layer V (L5) pyramidal cells in rat frontal cortex into three physiological subtypes based on the presence (spike frequency adaptation-d type) or absence (spike frequency adaptation type) of an initial burst in neurons displaying slowly adapting spike trains, or fast spike frequency adaptation (frequency adaptation type) against current pulse injections.
19641119	332	The preservation of spike timing relative to theta phase, rather than absolute time, suggests that dorsal hippocampal– prefrontal communication is governed by conduction delays (Lubenov and Siapas, 2008) and intermediate structures, which correlate the incoming inputs to local activities and theta oscillations and generate distinctly timed cell assemblies rather than monosynaptic mirror images of their inputs.
8574660	141	The highly prevalent location of the soma of in bursting neurons was restricted to layer Vb, from where most of the recordings were obtained, whereas the regular spiking neurons neurons were diffusely distributed in the layer V.

12456830	306	At this stage, we do not know whether the lower frequency is the result of a smaller dendritic area or simply reflects an intrinsic difference in the properties of the presynaptic terminals (target-cell specificity).
22798946	461	Finally, the barrel-related motor cortices in the two brain hemispheres are interconnected via the claustrum (Smith and Alloway, 2010) and layer 6 with pyramidal cells in this cortex project back to the contralateral ventromedial and the ventrolateral nuclei of the thalamus (Alloway et al., 2008), suggesting a modulatory role of motor cortex in somatosensory signaling and in the bilateral coordination of whisker movement.
18466749	236	For a given cell, we established a current amplitude sufficient to reliably drive a single AP (in 10/10 trials) in response to a 10 ms ramp.
21368112	16	The majority of slender-tufted neurons carry phase information upon free-whisking (i.e., selfmotion of whiskers).
22114282	170	To quantify the ocular preference of visual cortical neurons, I compared the peak amplitudes of subthreshold and suprathreshold responses to stimulation with optimally oriented moving light bars, which were separately presented to the contralateral and ipsilateral eyes (see Materials and Methods).

16457955	57	No correction factors were applied to the spine counts (e.g. see Feldman and Peters, 1979; Larkman, 1991) as the high power reconstruction of cells permits all dendritic spines to be visualized (i.e., the DAB reaction product is more transparent than the Golgi reaction product).
11826166	18	Movement of whiskers at the rodent's muzzle is thought to be represented in the cortex by a pattern of electrical activity in an ensemble of neurones in the corresponding cortical `representational area' (Woolsey & van der Loos, 1970; Jones & Diamond, 1995; Diamond et al. 1999).
18216227	308	B: EPSC density ( ) in layers 2/3 (black EPSC circles) and 4 (red squares) is plotted against the lateral distance from the recorded cell (n 6 cells).
16369481	142	Notably, within each of these families, paralogs were expressed in different patterns across the different cell types (Supplementary Note), supporting the idea that paralogs contribute to functional differences between cell types.
9236245	120	In the thalamus, CT cells that project to VPm and posterior group distribute branches in the thalamic reticular complex, but the terminal fields in ventral posteromedial nucleus and posterior group were too faintly labeled to be f ully reconstructed (but see Bourassa et al., 1995).
11826166	14	Therefore transmission of signals to layer 2/3 is likely to have a high threshold requiring simultaneous activation of many layer 4 neurons, implying that layer 4 spiny neurone to L2/3 pyramidal cell synapses act as a gate for the lateral spread of excitation in layer 2/3.
20927409	138	The delayed increase in sIPSC frequency is selectively expressed in autaptic fast-spiking interneurons.

15737062	217	Indeed one could have thought that, since each neuron receives inputs from thousands of others collectively determining its dynamics, analysis of few-neuron motifs is akin to "searching under the street light." Yet, the finding of a heavy tail in the connection strength distribution suggests that a lot of power is due to a few connections.
17317752	184	We found that the occurrence of spontaneous high-frequency bursts in general was very limited (∼11%) and was not different for L5 thick-tufted cells compared with other layers (Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn's post hoc test, n.s., data not shown).
10884314	228	Of the total number of boutons investigated (n = 200; 75 in layer 4 and 125 in layer 2/3), the vast majority of the target structures in layers 4 and 2/3 were excitatory spiny neurons.

15182718	206	Their amplitudes were small (range, 10–300 pA; average, 79 16 pA), consistent with the firing of a single or few presynaptic neurons.
22114282	193	In one group of cells, visually driven firing is almost monocularly driven through the contralateral eye (5NPs), whereas in the other group the vast majority of cells were highly binocular (5TPs).
11588205	171	The observed somatic colocalization of SK1 and L-type D class channels suggests that the slow afterhyperpolarization is generated in the soma of these neurons.

18971461	283	Common inputs from L2/3 to L5 cells were highly selective between connected cell pairs, respectively of the same subtype, but not different subtypes.
17267749	271	Effects of EGTA on synaptic release were previously documented for layer 5 cells (without any Ca2 in the electrode; Ohana and Sakmann 1998), but in our hands control experiments with no pairing protocol produced little change in mean amplitude after 1 h of recording (only 1 12% depression on average, n 10; data not shown).

21917809	188	Four pyramidal cells in somatosensory cortex layer 2/3 were patched and the surrounding positive interneurons in four different focal planes were optically stimulated.
9236245	29	The present study had two main objectives: (1) to determine whether the two subpopulations of CT cells in lamina VI of the cortical barrel field display differences in the intracortical distribution of their dendritic and axonal processes, and (2) to better characterize the axonal projection patterns of the other cell types that are colocalized with CT cells in lamina VI of the rat primary somatosensory cortex.
22593736	29	Layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were identified by their somatic shape, the location of their somata 150–500 μm from the pial edge of the slice, and their large apical dendrites that were visible by fluorescence microscopy once filled with indicator.

22114282	166	Binocularity of synaptic inputs is not uniform: postsynaptic potential responses of 5TPs and 2/3Ps were more binocular compared with 5NPs Because ocular dominance plasticity is thought to be the outcome of a process of activity-dependent competition between the two eyes (Wiesel and Hubel, 1965; Gordon and Stryker, 1996), the shift of ocular preference caused by monocular deprivation is expected to be larger in cells that receive more binocular inputs in normal conditions.
12900914	297	Previous studies in the developing rat and mouse visual cortex have shown that parvalbumin is first expressed at P11 and that the proportion of parvalbumin neurons in layer 2/3 peaks at P21 (Alcantara et al., 1993; Del Rio et al., 1994).
9236245	18	A large number of these neurons give rise to corticothalamic axons, but retrograde tracer studies have also revealed a number of lamina V I cells with ipsilateral corticocortical projections to distant cortical fields or to the claustrum (Z illes and Wree, 1995; Sherk, 1986).
22798946	55	Axons arising from ventral posterior medial nucleus neurons in the barreloid core innervate predominantly layer 4 and 6A of the corresponding somatosensory barrel column and to a lesser extent also layer 3 and 5B (Bureau et al., 2006; Cruikshank et al., 2010; Oberlaender et al., 2011b) and have single-whisker receptive fields (Ito, 1988; Simons and Carvell, 1989; Armstrong-James and Callahan, 1991; Diamond et al., 1992; Brecht and Sakmann, 2002b).

17698015	60	Cell-attached recordings from the soma of layer 5 pyramidal neurons showed that positive voltage steps (to +45 mV) from a negative holding potential (110 mV) evoked fast-activating and slow-inactivating K+ currents of small amplitude (Figure 2A; average: 4.0 ± 1.2 pA, n = 10).

17122323	107	Responses in layer 5 medial prefrontal cortex neurons (n 10) were significantly larger than those in somatosensory (n 10) or visual cortex ( 7.0 3.4 mV in medial prefrontal cortex vs. 2.5 1.4 in somatosensory and 3.6 1.4 mV in visual cortex; n 29 total cells; P 0.001, ANOVA).

9570781	251	This crossover is unlikely to be caused by activation of other voltage-activated conductances, because previous studies have shown that there is little contribution of voltage-activated Na+ or Ca2+ conductances to small (<5 mV at the soma) EPSPs generated in the main apical dendrite of layer V pyramidal neurons (Stuart and Sakmann, 1995).
18787231	317	These findings are consistent with a series of studies that used quantitative methods for the analysis of electrophysiological or dendritic classes of neurons (Nowak et al. 2003; Krimer et al. 2005; Zaitsev et al. 2005).

14960603	395	At the same time, GABA released from bitufted cell dendrites would “buffer” the excitation of bitufted cells and thus limit the bitufted-to-pyramidal feedback inhibition.

15987765	322	In subsequent in vitro studies of the prefrontal cortex, the term “fast-spiking cell” was assigned to only a subpopulation of interneurons with the shortest spikes and nonadapting firing properties (Kawaguchi 1993), whereas the other often encountered a subset of interneurons with wider spikes and adapting firing patterns was designated as regular-spiking nonpyramidal cells (Kawaguchi 1995; Kawaguchi and Kubota 1997).

17522314	84	Several series of sections were stained with an antibody against vesicular acetylcholine transporter raised in goat (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), which is considered to by a highly specific marker for cholinergic neurons and, in addition, a robust antigen detectable with very high sensitivity (Schafer et al., 1995; Weihe et al., 1996).
15737062	255	We stopped short of calling stronger connections among layer 5 pyramidal neurons drivers, and weaker connections modulators, for two reasons.
21451062	218	In this cell there was a small transient and a larger persistent component to the putative Kv1mediated current.
12514205	274	The general properties of the electrical coupling among late-spiking cells, including the coupling strength, are similar to those among fastspiking and low-threshold spiking cells (Galarreta and Hestrin, 2001b).

19295167	682	Polythetic classification schemes of cortical neurons Our classification of cortical neurons was based on laminar location and electrophysiological and molecular features (see Materials and Methods) chosen to describe physiological and molecular phenotypes described in the literature (Ascoli et al., 2008).
9007187	109	Neurones possessing both specific immunoreactivity and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase activity are termed immunopositive/diaphorase-reactive (e.g., calretinin+/D+, Parvalbumin+/D+, calbindin D-28k+/D+, or g-aminobutyric acid+/D+).
18971461	36	We then investigated the spatial distribution of L2/3 cells innervating L5 pyramidal subtypes, and the divergence pattern from L2/3 to L5 cell pairs, respectively.
16093380	127	However, at postnatal day 12, the activity of low-threshold spiking and regular-spiking cell pairs was entirely uncorrelated in the presence of ACPD (mean peak correlation, 0.00 0.15), and there was a general paucity of subthreshold activity in both cell populations.

22114282	181	A comparison between the subthreshold ODIs (postsynaptic potential-ODIs) of the cell populations under study revealed indeed that the ocular preference of V1 pyramids is not uniform across layers and cell types (Fig. 4 A; Kruskall– Wallis ANOVA on ranks, p 0.001).
17122323	395	We examined cholinergic modulation of excitability in a variety of neuron-types in several neocortical areas of the rat and report heterogenous actions of acetylcholine that may explain some of the disparate conclusions drawn from earlier studies.
9236245	27	The labeling of small pools of cells, however, rarely allows the identification of the cell of origin of each axon and the mapping of its local net of collaterals.
16467534	72	Myelinating processes were visualized using confocal microscope (LSM 510; Zeiss), and layer 5 pyramidal neurons with cell bodies immediately above (closer to the pia) myelinating processes of oligodendrocytes were selected and patched with patch pipettes containing the green fluorescent dye Oregon Green 488 (150 M; Invitrogen).

18216227	48	Thus in using this method, it is difficult to map synaptic connections within the three-dimensional tissue at the single-cell level.
22798946	346	While the thick-tufted (L5B) pyramidal cells are to some degree innervated by descending axon collaterals of L5A pyramidal cells, ascending connections from layer 5B to 5A appear to be rare, suggesting a directed signal flow between the two sublaminae (Lefort et al., 2009).
14645486	279	This high percentage of feedback inputs contrasts with the much smaller proportion of 5.1% (20 of 395) of unlabeled asymmetric synapses on calretinin profiles in the neuropil of layer 1 of area 17. calretinin neurons in layer 1 also receive inputs from symmetric synapses, some of which are calretinin-immunoreactive.

15101088	5	A consistent fraction of parameters (11 of 30) was significantly different between CA3 and CA1 cells.
22002739	183	The threshold for generating action potential (Vthre) was about -32.5 ± 0.5 mV in subplate neurons of P1 rats, and it decreased dramatically to -41 *-43 mV at the beginning of the second week then stayed constant afterward (Fig. 4b).
18971461	37	Our results suggest that the interlaminar synaptic pathways originating from L2/3 are segregated according to L5 pyramidal subtypes, and that these subtypedependent pathways are further segregated into modules of synaptically interconnected cells.
14602839	55	The second type of mechanisms consists of interactions with other cells, in particular synaptic transmission between neurons.
17478724	57	The responses were abolished by bath application of the g-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide (20 mM) and after reversal could then be abolished again by application of the non–N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulphonamide (NBQX) (10 mM, n = 6 neuron pairs), indicating that they were polysynaptic IPSCs (Fig. 1B).

20720120	297	The physiologically identified inhibitory interneuron groups in all layers tended to fire at the supplemental material phase (near the entorhinal cortex3 theta trough and on the ascending phase), with the entorhinal cortex2 group showing the strongest theta modulation (Fig. 9D–F; p 0.005, ANOVA), and were silenced together at approximately the supplemental material theta phase.
15539396	33	Tetrodotoxin (Tetrodotoxin; Tocris Cookson, Bristol, UK), dendrotoxin-α (Dendrotoxin-α; Peptide Institute, Japan), most cell degranulating-peptide (most cell degranulating-P; Peptide Institute), tityustoxin Kα (tityustoxin Kα; Peptide Institute), margatoxin (margatoxin; Peptide Institute), stychodactyla toxin (stychodactyla toxin; Peptide Institute) and agitoxin (agitoxin; Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) were stored at -20◦C as stock solutions in doubly distilled water.
15737062	52	Synaptic connection strengths were assessed by evoking action potentials in each of the four cells and measuring the averaged peak excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes in the other three cells (see Figure 1C and Materials and Methods).
14645486	290	The numerical density of calretinin neurons in area lateromedial area is 20 –26% higher than in area 17, which parallels the difference found between V1 and V2 in monkey (DeFelipe et al., 1999). calretinin neurons in layer 2/3 of rat and monkey visual cortex are densely innervated by symmetric and asymmetric synapses (Meskenaite, 1997; Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1999b).
9592109	113	Orientation tuning could also be seen in complex cells that contained either of the two voltage-dependent mechanisms alone.
10980023	151	Organized into granular, supragranular, and infragranular responses based on the approximate laminar extent of these cytoarchitectural regions (Fig. 5, g, s, and i, respectively), Excitatory postsynaptic potential latency could be ranked as follows: granular cells, 5.1 6 0.12 ms; supragranular cells, 6.0 6 0.20 ms; infragranular cells, 7.6 6 0.28 ms.
22002739	180	The decrease in the resistance reflected the rapid growth of subplate neurons during early postnatal days because of the reversal trend of the capacitance (Fig. 3d).
11826166	1	Single action potentials in the layer 4 spiny neurone evoked single unitary EPSPs in the L2/3 pyramidal cell with a peak amplitude of 0.7 ± 0.6 mV.
15101088	214	Two protocols were used, namely, equal (non-normalized) somatic current injection to each of the neurons, and somatic current injection normalized by each neuron's impedance (approximately resulting in an equal initial depolarization to all neurons).
15987765	264	Nine interneurons displayed a mixed firing pattern (Fig. 12, A and B).
22427971	44	At the network level, information is encoded in the spiking of neurons and there is much debate about the level of precision that is important [1,2].

8459275	201	2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), a selective antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, suppressed the long-lasting components of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials of fast-spiking cells, but early spike firing at resting potential was never blocked by APV (Fig. 5 B).
11826166	167	This difference was statistically significant (Student's unpaired t test; P = 0.02) and could be due to a lower density of axon collaterals of the layer 4 spiny neurones and hence a reduced probability of forming synaptic contacts (Lübke et al. 2000; see also Fig.
11826166	282	The axonal projection, and in particular the dendritic arborisation of the layer 4 spiny neurone, as well as the dendritic arborisation of the L2/3 pyramidal cell are largely confined to the `home' column (as defined by the border of the barrel in layer 4: Lübke et al. 2000; J. Lübke, A.
7904301	337	The long-lasting sink sink that was also present in upper layers probably reflects polysynaptic inputs from small-amplitude field potentialswereevoked outside the recorded column onto the proximal dendrites of layer I and I pyramidal cells.
9570781	118	In addition, the extent of sag in the somatic response to a long current pulse (control steady-state response/control peak response) was also not significantly different when measured with the different recording conditions [0.81 6 0.01 (n = 13) with whole-cell compared with 0.86 6 0.03 (n = 5) with perforated-patch].
15525762	65	Fast-spiking cells were enhanced green fluorescent protein negative and were identified by their typical discharges of high-frequency nonaccommodating spikes in response to near-threshold current injection (Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997).
16793907	111	The distance between the somata of synaptically coupled layer 2/3 pyramidal cells ranged from 10 to 89 μm (average 42 ± 20 μm), i.e. virtually all of the pyramidal cell pairs investigated here were located within the same barrel column.
16093380	241	We conclude that the strength of low-threshold spiking cell-mediated inhibition increased between postnatal day 12 and P15.

22798946	482	Thus, the whisker-related somatosensory and S2 cortex are interconnected by at least two different routes: a direct feedforward route from thalamus to somatosensory and from there to S2 via long-range axon collaterals of somatosensory neurons and through a corticothalamocortical feedback involving the posteromedial.
15525762	301	Bottom panels show data from examples in which the spikelet in the postsynaptic cell did not reach spike threshold.
16793907	163	In 28 synaptically coupled cell pairs, the coefficient of variation (c.v.) of unitary EPSPs ranged from 0.11 to 0.84, with a mean of 0.33 ± 0.18 (Fig. 2B and C), again suggesting a high reliability of these connections.

19474331	270	The gabra1/gabra5 ratio measured by our microarray screen increased 61-fold between postnatal day 7 and P25 and was inversely correlated with the trajectory of mIPSC Decay (Fig. 8C), suggesting that developmental sharpening of inhibitory transmission attributable to this GABAA receptor subunit switch may be a general property of multiple neocortical cell types.

19641119	186	Dorsal CA1 pyramidal cells In all experiments, theta oscillations were recorded in the dorsal have been reported to fire strongest at 20° just after the trough of CA1 area because theta oscillations are highly coherent across this dorsal CA1 theta oscillations under similar conditions (Klausrelatively flat structure, and the CA1 pyramidal cell layer could be berger et al., 2003) and also in drug-free rats (Skaggs et al., 1996).

15737062	448	However, since there are relatively few neurons with axon cut distance of more than 600 lm and the increase in connection probability is not statistically significant, we do not expect this to fully explain our results.
17317752	193	In L2/3 and L5 slender-tufted cells, evoked action potential responses were very low, and latency estimates would be based on single APs, making their interpretation ambiguous.

20927409	372	Finally, asynchronous release was detectable in few perforated-patch experiments (data not shown), directly ruling out the possibility that it is due to imbalanced ion homeostasis and/or dialysis due to whole-cell recording.

17898147	319	The responses of corticothalamic and -trigeminal neurons to depolarizing current injection, an initial doublet followed by trains of nonadapting single action potentials, differed from rhythmic burst firing that has been described in corticotectal and unlabeled cells in the visual and sersorimotor corticies (Connors et al. 1982; Kasper et al. 1994; Rumberger et al. 1998).
17898147	48	However, analysis of additional parameters, including axonal and dendritic branching patterns, spike frequency adaptation, and afterpolarizations (Agmon and Connors 1992; Gottlieb and Keller 1997; Kang and Kayano 1994; Tsiola et al. 2003), reveals a rich diversity of layer V pyramidal cells.
17898147	255	The membrane potentials of corticothalamic and -trigeminal neurons are significantly more positive than those of callosal and corticostriatal neurons, which may have contributed to the differences seen in spike frequency adaptation, firingcurrent slope and firing threshold.
22232599	98	Indeed, due to the cutting procedure, the slice edges contain mainly dead cells and the thickness of these edges has been estimated to be 35–50 μm from each side (Feig and Lipton, 1990; Frenguelli et al., 2003).

22798946	374	In the somatosensory cortex of rodents the relative thickness of infragranular L5A and L5B pyramidal neurons in rodents is significantly larger than that of supragranular L5A and L5B pyramidal neurons; the thickness of layer 6 is almost equal to that of layer 5 (Ren et al., 1992; Hutsler et al., 2005).
15912501	379	Labeled overlap was not strongly correlated among other pairs of brain regions, and this finding is consistent with the fact that most of the SI projections to these brain regions originate from different populations of neurons.

20927409	96	We rarely detected delayed inhibitory events when fast-spiking interneurons fired action potentials at frequencies smaller than 100 Hz, despite a few exceptions at 60–70 Hz (data not shown), suggesting that this phenomenon requires relatively high frequency firing.

17317752	331	The APs emitted by layer 2/3 cells and L5 slender-tufted cells account for only a small fraction of the total columnar action potential output (25 and 15%, respectively).
11826166	220	Assuming a Q10 of 3–4 for channel kinetics, the NMDAR EPSC decay time constant at the spiny stellate–L2/3 pyramidal cell synapse is comparable with this value.
10980023	335	However, such results are consistent with accumulating evidence that Fast spiking cells form a functionally continuous network.
19641119	331	Interestingly, the phase locking of prefrontal and hippocampal pyramidal cells to the theta peak and trough, respectively, has also been reported in freely moving rats, in which theta oscillations occur at a significantly faster frequency of 6 –10 Hz (Hyman et al., 2005; Siapas et al., 2005).

15912501	319	Because the superior colliculus receives projections from collaterals of neurons that project to the pons (Baker et al., 1983; Keizer et al., 1987; Levesque et al., 1996a,b; Glickstein, 2003), interanimal variations in overlap might be correlated for these brain regions but not others.

22514308	567	In layer 2/3, pyramidal cells were found to receive 10 times as many inhibitory connections as excitatory connections, many of which were reciprocal (Holmgren et al., 2003).
16369481	269	The distance between samples prepared from dissociated but unsorted cell suspensions from different mouse lines (G42 and GIN, n = 3 each) was 0.22, further supporting the fact that strain differences are not responsible for the large observed differences between cell types.
18971461	183	The connection probability from a single cell to two postsynaptic cells in another layer is higher when two recipient cells have connections with each other, suggesting the existence of segregated cortical pathways dependent on connectivity of the recipient layer (Yoshimura et al., 2005; Kampa et al., 2006).
22171028	74	After impalement, the response of the pyramidal neuron to current injection was recorded with a current-clamp amplifier (IR-183; Cygnus Technology) and stored in a computer through an analog-digital converter (PowerLab; ADInstruments).
21704132	362	This could in turn be due to the combined effects of two observations: (a) the spiking of thalamic neurons is more reliable and synchronous compared to that of L4Ps (Kara et al., 2000); (b) synaptic inputs on L4Ps are more proximal to the axon APs trigger zone in L4Ps.

22427971	168	The functional consequence of coincidence detection in pyramidal neurons depends also on the particular inputs that are associated.
15539396	245	For example, the membrane potential was measured 31 μm away from the soma (Fig. 9A), and APs were initiated either by somatic square-pulse current injections or by trains of facilitating EPSPs generated by stimulation of a pyramidal cell (not shown in the field of view in Fig.

22798946	375	The structure of layer 6 reflects its mixed origin with sublamina 6A being derived from the cortical plate (like layer 2–5) while sublamina 6B is a heterogeneous layer that contains neurons that have developed—at least to some extent—from the subplate but may also hold neurons that have migrated there from the cortical plate (Marín-Padilla, 1978).

22171028	351	With this additive mechanism, even on a weak, limited sensory input, the barrel cortex could provide a commensurate strength of excitatory/facilitatory feedback to all relay neurons in the corresponding barreloid, and finely control the thalamic activity to efficiently transfer information from the corresponding whisker to the cortex.
21880904	111	visual cells were significantly more dynamic than visual and somatosensory cells at 4.28 0.63% dynamic branch tips/week (visual vs visual, Mann–Whitney U test, p 0.02; somatosensory vs visual, Mann–Whitney U test, p 0.05) (Fig. 2C).
21917809	351	This estimate is lower than what we found but it also predicts only N(R 1) 25 17 425 connections from positive interneurons to pyramidal cells, which is low when one considers the large number of boutons present in a single positive axon ( 4000) (Wang et al., 2002; Karube et al., 2004).

21880904	142	Cells within visual exhibit higher dynamics compared to visual and somatosensory due to a higher frequency of events and recruitment of more dendrites per event.
18466749	183	Briefly, we filled fast-spiking cells via the patch pipette with a fluorescent dye (Figure S10A1) and followed the axon back to its approximate origin (Figures S10B and S10C1).
21753015	39	The pipette solution for whole-cell recording consisted of the following (in mM): 130 potassium gluconate, 2 KCl, 2 MgCl , 3 ATP, 0.3 GTP, 10 2 HEPES, and 20 biocytin, pH 7.0, 290 mOsm.
19759293	28	Focal stimulation of pyramidal cell axons with an NMDA receptor agonist failed to depolarize the axon, alter axonal excitability, or evoke NMDA receptor-mediated Ca 2 influx.
15101088	39	Here, we report the resulting statistical analysis, which indicates that the differences among separated subgroups within T1 of neurons reconstructed from different laboratories are as considerable as those observed between morphological classes.

12695107	20	Recent compartment models of reconstructed cortical neurons have demonstrated that the full spectrum of observed firing patterns can be reproduced in a range of model neurons with common ion distributions, differing only in the extent of arborization of their dendritic geometries [6–8].
15456817	252	The estimated average dendritic length of the cell types not present in the database of reconstructed neurons has only a small effect on the summed length (Fig. 6C, white bars), because the frequency of neurons of these cell types is generally small.
18466749	77	This range reflects a large amount of absolute current (95 ± 29 pA), as fast-spiking cells have a low input resistance and a depolarized voltage threshold for AP generation and hence exhibit large values for ITH (381 ± 116 pA; n = 23) as compared to pyramidal cells (175 ± 51; n = 16; p < 0.01 versus fast-spiking cells).

15987765	61	To preserve calcium-binding proteins in the recorded cells, we used short recording times (5–7 min; Kawaguchi 1995), which in turn precluded reliable morphological recovery of many interneurons.
20550566	23	This sensory information is signalled to neurons in the principal and spinal trigeminal nuclei via excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the brain stem.
21880904	148	Since the increased dynamics of visual interneurons as compared to visual and somatosensory is largely due to additional recruitment of remodeling dendrites, one can speculate that visual neurons are more dynamic because they receive multiple distinct streams of input and may be required to locally adjust the relative weights of these inputs within the circuit.
19641119	316	So-called “early fast spiking interneurons” were strongly coupled to the spindle cycle and fired during earlier phases than “late firing fast spiking cells”.

17317752	351	The peak of action potential activity is during the interval of 10–20 ms after the sensory stimulus and returns to baseline within 150 ms (which is true for all cell types), which corresponds to the time window between consecutive whisking movements (e.g. at 7–12 Hz).
19151697	64	The positions of ventral posterior medial nucleus, L4, L2/3 and M1 input along the apical axis of L3 neurons mirrors the flow of excitation within the cortical circuit: more peripheral input impinges on lower parts of the dendritic arborization, whereas more central input impinges on higher parts of the dendritic arborization.

19474331	7	Using our microarray screen as a guide, we discovered that upregulation of two-pore K leak channels between postnatal day 10 and P25 contributes to one of the major differences between the intrinsic membrane properties of immature and adult fast-spiking cells and found a number of other candidate genes that likely confer cell-type specificity on mature fast-spiking cells.

15987765	375	We also have described a subgroup of interneurons with an unusual combination of nonadapting and adapting firing patterns, which has not been described in rat PFC.
22798946	38	In mouse barrel cortex, the total number of neurons in a barrel-related column is only about a third of the value observed for the rat (∼6500 neurons) of which 11% are inhibitory interneuron (Lefort et al., 2009), a fraction similar to that found for the rat.
8574660	236	In almost 60% of the in bursting neurons that we recorded, the initial burst was followed by a regular train of short-lasting (1.14 + 0.37 ms) and non-accommodating action potentials, each of which was associated with a prominent DAP.

12746859	134	In sections processed with cresyl violet, the primary visual cortex was characterized by the darker staining of layer 4 due to the higher density of small cells (Fig. 1A).
2332787	292	Much of the difference between our values and those of prc-I ious studies may be due to our ability to reconstruct cells reliably across tissue section boundaries, and our attempt to correct for 2-dimensional projection errors.
9236245	229	The large number of connections made in lamina V I by the basket cells suggests that they take part in a powerful, recurrent inhibitory network that directly controls the firing of corticothalamic cells.
15182718	86	Development of Layer 4 → 2/3 Circuits Neurons above barrels rapidly gained excitatory synaptic input from layer 4 with development (factor of 2.0 between PND 8 and 12; 3.3 between PND 12 and 16; see Experimental Procedures).
10884314	8	Electron microscopy combined with GABA postimmunogold labeling revealed that most (>90%) of the synaptic contacts were established on dendritic spines and shafts of excitatory neurons in layers 4 and 2/3.
15737062	242	However, such connections occur with a very low probability (about 1/1000, estimated from lognormal distribution), meaning that there are only about 20 of such connections in the considered network and that therefore most neurons do not have them.

17334362	15	Furthermore, circuit dynamics allowed feedforward inhibition to suppress responses in excitatory cells more effectively than in interneurons.
19474331	302	In particular, it is well appreciated that Kv3 potassium channels enable fast spiking in these cells by providing rapid membrane repolarization after an action potential (Erisir et al., 1999; Lau et al., 2000; Rudy and McBain, 2001).

18971461	250	This finding corresponds well with a previous report that L5 pyramidal cells with thick tufted apical dendrites (as found here in spike frequency adaptation and spike frequency adaptation-d cells) receive more frequent inputs from L2/3 pyramidal cells than those with slender apical dendrites (Thomson and Bannister, 1998).
19295167	256	They also typically (Kawaguchi, 1993; Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1993) fired action potentials of short duration and small amplitude (see Table 7) with sharp and monophasic (n 25 of 34 neurons) fast AHP (Fig. 2 A, C) (see Table 7).
21917809	360	However, Fast-spiking cells that were reciprocally connected to pyramidal cells shared more common input from excitatory sources than those that were not reciprocally connected (Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005).
2332787	84	For layer 2/3 cells, the spread time was 20-40 min, whereas for layer 5 cells it was usually 60-90 min.

16793907	265	Pyramidal cells in the lower half of layer 2/3 display a more prominent apical dendrite with a number of oblique collaterals, extending up to 300 μm before bifurcating close to layer 1 giving rise to a terminal tuft.
17698015	76	Similar time constants were found in both cell-attached (n = 7) and whole-cell recordings (n = 7) and were therefore pooled.
17698015	73	The midpoint of half-maximum inactivation was 44.9 ± 1.5 mV, with a slope factor of 12.1, indicating that axonal K+ channels are fully available for activation at resting membrane potentials but will undergo substantial inactivation during depolarization (Figure 2C; 2 whole-cell recordings, 4 cell-attached patches).
7904301	346	Most of the input generating sink sink in upper layer V probably originated from the upper layers, thus defining a disynaptic pathway from pyramidal cells in layer II/III to the dendritic field at the border of layers III and V.
12900914	135	Axon terminals often formed baskets around unstained cell bodies that resembled somata of pyramidal neurons.
9236245	199	Corticothalamic cells would contact, by means of their collaterals, those cortical neurons that are the targets of the thalamocortical cells they innervate.
10980023	147	Only intrinsic bursting cells exhibited a preferred laminar distribution and were found exclusively in layer V, whereas Regular spiking and Fast spiking cells were uniformly distributed in the cortical lamina (Fig. 4D).
17317752	115	Layer 6 cells were identified based on their short apical dendrites that never extended beyond the granular layer (n = 15).
12900914	144	At P16, dendrites of parvalbumin neurons in layers 4 and 5 of areas 17 and lateromedial were intensely labeled, and immunostaining spread throughout the entire dendritic tree.
16467534	71	Oligodendrocytes were identified by their characteristic spherical cell body using differential interference contrast imaging and filled with the red fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 568 (10 M).
20927409	258	To directly test the actual contribution of asynchronous GABA release to the spiking reliability reduction seen in fast-spiking cells, we repeated the frozen noise stimulations in the presence of 10 μM gabazine and compared the response of fast-spiking cells before and after blocking GABAA-receptor-mediated transmission.
15525762	286	In contrast, large cholecystokinin-containing basket neurons are generally negative for VIP and calretinin (Kawaguchi and Kondo, 2002) but express cannabinoid receptor-1 receptors (Bodor et al., 2003).
15737062	259	Although it is possible that the neurons bound by stronger connections form a distinct subclass defined by perhaps distinct long-range projection patterns, or different channel densities and/or gene expression patterns, it is also possible that the distributions arise as a natural consequence of activity-dependent plasticity rules.
19759293	231	NMDA receptors are enriched in postsynaptic membranes (Fagg and Matus, 1984; Monaghan and Cotman; 1986), including layer 5 pyramidal cell dendrites and spines, and contribute to synaptic excitability and Ca 2 influx.
18466749	221	To demonstrate that the effects of Kv1 location on fast-spiking cell near-threshold excitability were indeed robust (and not specific to a particular set of parameter values), we systematically varied the parameters of maximal conductance and time constants for activation and inactivation of IKv1 (Table S1).
19295167	161	A cluster A generated by K-means clustering was con-k-means sidered to match a cluster A generated by Ward's clustering if a Ward sufficiently large fraction of its elements belonged as well to the cluster A . K was then fixed by taking its smallest value for which all the Ward K-means clusters of Neuropeptide Y neurons matched a Ward's cluster.
16457955	58	The estimation of the total number of spines in the pyramidal cell basal dendritic tree was calculated by multiplying the average number of spines of a given portion of the dendrite by the average number of branches for the corresponding region over the entire dendritic tree (Elston, 2001), in both 2-D and 3-D.

21704132	346	Indeed, L2/3Ps were activated about 25 ms later than L4Ps and their Vm is modulated by optimized sinusoidal drifting gratings as expected for complex and simple cells, respectively.
20927409	86	fast-spiking interneurons were visually identified under infrared videomicroscopy as multipolar neurons lacking clear apical dendrites.
20550566	39	Thalamocortical neurons located in so-called `barreloids' of the ventroposterior medial densely innervate layer 4 (with a more sparse innervation of upper layer 6), with each whisker being individually represented by a segregated termination field of somatotopically arranged thalamocortical axons defining the cortical barrel map (Fig. 1B and C; Woolsey & Van der Loos, 1970).
19759293	220	The lack of subthreshold depolarization-evoked Ca 2 transients in layer 5 pyramidal cell axon varicosities might suggest that somatic depolarizations are greatly attenuated by axonal cable filtering.
19151697	111	For example, input on the apical tufts of L5 neurons could be reduced several-fold relative to more proximal input11.
17898147	299	The properties of these corticostriatal neurons closely resembled the morphological and physiological properties of corticothalamic neurons and thus may be representative of corticostriatal neurons that send a collateral to the thalamus.
20927409	467	AP firing in fast-spiking interneurons (both single and trains of spikes) never induced firing in nearby fast-spiking cells whether they were synaptically connected (n = 4) or not (n = 12), ruling out the possibility that increased sIPSC frequency in response to highfrequency trains is due to depolarizing GABAergic responses that would induce firing in neighboring fast-spiking interneurons.
19474331	57	The cell suspension was then poured into a small Petri dish, and, under visual control on a fluorescence dissecting microscope, green fluorescent protein-expressing neurons were aspirated into a micropipette with a 30 –50 m tip diameter and transferred to a clean dish.
16467534	165	All neurons exhibited two distinct components, presumably resulting from the separate charging of the initial segment and the soma.
22114282	86	After capacitance compensation, a ramp of negative pressure usually led to whole-cell configuration.
19805321	29	What comes to us as a surprise is that the distributions of actual synapse numbers between synaptically coupled neurons forming these projections are highly tuned; i.e., the ratios between variance and mean (the Fano factor) of these distributions are significantly less than 1: 0.060 for L43L2/3, 0.21 for L53L5, and 0.31 for L43L4 projections.

18787231	556	Physiologically distinct temporal cohorts of cortical interneurons arise from telencephalic Olig2-expressing precursors.
11826166	110	For light neurones (~50 mm apart) were found to be synaptically microscopy 0.1 % Triton X-100 was added to the incubation coupled to the same L2/3 pyramidal cell, indicating a high solution.
21917809	135	Overall, we found that, in nine of 10 cases, true positive positive cells generated short latencies IPSCs in the PC, indicative of monosynaptic transmission (1.12 0.19 ms, n 9 pairs; Fig.
18466749	286	Moreover, local application of DTX-K to the fast-spiking cell axon, but not to the soma, reproduced the effects of bath-applied toxins, firmly demonstrating the axonal localization of the Kv1 dampening mechanism.
16267239	28	Whole-cell recording 22 pipettes (5–7 M ) contained the following (in mM): 135 K-gluconate or K-methylsulfate, 7 NaCl, 2 MgCl , 10 HEPES, 2 Na ATP, and 0.3 22 NaGTP, pH 7.2 with KOH.

19151697	315	Only data from neurons where the apical dendrites ran parallel to the slice surface were included in the analysis.
15987765	49	Although some studies of interneurons have been able to correlate electrophysiological properties with specific morphological subtypes and/or the presence of specific calcium-binding proteins (Bacci et al. 2003; Blatow et al. 2003; Cauli et al. 1997; Chu et al. 2003; Gao et al. 2003; Gibson et al. 1999; Kawaguchi 1995; Rozov et al. 2001), others have not (Chitwood and Jaffe 1998; Parra et al. 1998; Porter et al. 2001).
20927409	367	The specific sensitivity of asynchronous release to high concentrations of EGTA, together with its modulation by the 2+ endogenous Ca buffer parvalbumin, raises the question of whether it results from dialysis of endogenous buffers and/or other important metabolites that are lost during invasive whole-cell recordings.
14960603	8	The localized enhancement of dendritic Ca 2 influx at synaptic contacts by synaptically evoked backpropagating action potentials could represent one mechanism by which a retrograde signal can limit the excitation of bitufted interneurons by layer 2/3 pyramids when these are repetitively active.
14645486	14	Because feedforward pathways and feedback connections terminate in different layers (Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993), this may be achieved by the effects of layerspecific inputs to different types of inhibitory neurons.

22002739	153	Two types of subplate neurons are distinguished by current injections (a).
19914188	55	Sparseness measures do not fully summarize the character of a neuron's sensory tuning; for example, while the measured sparseness of L2/3 and L6 Pyramidal cells was not significantly different, visual examination of their spectral tuning suggested that L6 Pyramidal cells (but not L2/3 Pyramidal cells) carry little information about stimuli during onset periods.
18082394	87	The antibodies themselves do the `heavy lifting' of discriminating neurons, arbors and synapses and the basis of distinctive antigens, making it relatively easy for known volume image analysis and visualization tools (e.g. [27,28]; B.

10980023	367	A principal finding of the present study was that, in at least some cells, action potentials in the vibrissae-evoked response may align with more than one peak of fast oscillations activity (Figs.
7904301	382	The low amplitude of this sink may result from inhibitory interactions between layer V pyramidal cells (Landry et al. 1984; Stefanis and Jasper 1964).

17122323	40	acetylcholine was only inhibitory when presented near the somata of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, where repetitive acetylcholine applications generated discrete inhibitory events at frequencies of up to 0.5 Hz.
17317752	379	However, L5 slender-tufted cells can also be located in L5B (Schubert et al. 2001) and can therefore lead to different results, depending on the classification method.
12695107	274	Real-time inspection of entire neurons in three dimensions is possible using a combination of object culling and level of detail routines [43].
17122323	410	Layer 5 pyramidal neurons are themselves a heterogenous group in terms of their axonal projections and synaptic connectivity (Morishima and Kawaguchi 2006; Wang et al. 2006), and therefore it is possible that acetylcholine differentially gates the excitability of these neurons.
16093380	152	We tested inhibition directly by recording from 57 pairs of low-threshold spiking–regular-spiking cells from postnatal day 12 to P15.
20927409	165	Since fast-spiking interneurons are known to have a relatively depolarized reversal potential for GABA-mediated responses [47,48], summation of GABAergic events might lead connected fast-spiking interneurons to fire and thus transmit delayed synaptic activity onto the recorded neuron.
19295167	85	Firing behavior near threshold is also very informative about the electrophysiological diversity of cortical neurons.
16093380	92	regular-spiking cell pairs were stimulated to fire with long steps of depolarizing current, and their synchrony was compared in the presence versus absence of ACPD.
15987765	154	This group of neurons seemed to correspond to the description of regular-spiking nonpyramidal cells in rat frontal cortex (Kawaguchi and Kubota 1997).

2332787	344	This is in agreement with the finding that 93.5% ofthe basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons with cell bodies in the central regions of 350.pm-thick sections of rabbit auditory cortex terminate within the section (McMullen and <ilaser.
16701210	406	Cajal-Retzius cell ontogenesis and death in mouse brain visualized with horseradish peroxidase and electron microscopy.
21368112	82	Within the principal column, layer 5 slender-tufted neurons display two innervation zones: one in supragranular L2/L3 and one in infragranular layer 5; outside the principal column innervation is largely restricted to supragranular layers, indicating that layer 5 slender-tufted–layer 5 projections remain local (i.e., intracolumnar), whereas layer 5 slender-tufted–L2/L3 projections represent primarily long-range projections (i.e., leaving the principal column).
12900914	76	The development of parvalbumin expression in cell bodies was analyzed quantitatively by computer-assisted stereology using C.A.S.T.-Grid software (Olympus, Albertslund, Denmark).

14602839	338	Therefore the postnatal development of the intrinsic properties of neurons appears to be interrelated with the maturation of synaptic inputs.
16369481	172	neurons were GABA positive (immunocytochemistry, data not shown), but unlike G42-cingulate cortex neurons, they were not parvalbumin positive (Supplementary Note) or fast-spiking (Fig. 1; n = 3).

9236245	203	Mapping the intracortical terminations of corticothalamic cells in the cortical barrel field, however, revealed that boutons are distributed all along the axonal branches as they ascend through the infragranular layers.
2332787	17	Slender layer 5 cells had less elongate somata and longer basal and oblique dendrites than the other cell classes.
21753015	161	Finally, the basal dendrites of L5a and layer 5b corticopontine cells cells were, overall, horizontally and vertically more compact than were the basal dendrites of L5a crossed-corticostriatal (p 0.05) and layer 5b crossed-corticostriatal cells (p 0.05) (Fig. 1C2,C3).
2332787	230	When only the basaldendrites were considered,it was found that the slenderand thick L5 cellswere not significantly different from eachother, but both weresignificantly largerthan the layer 213 cells.
17717695	176	Signal transmission to L2/3 pyramidal cells is therefore likely to have a high threshold requiring the simultaneous activation of about 50 spiny L4 neurons.

17717695	257	Paired recordings have revealed the existence of a functional L6 pyramidal cell-to-L4 spiny neuron connection in young adult cat visual cortex (Tarczy-Hornoch et al. 1999).
17898147	239	In response to depolarizing current injections, corticothalamic and -trigeminal neurons exhibit an initial doublet (inset) followed by trains of action potentials with little or no spike frequency adaptation (A and B).
9007187	807	Although the dendritic arrangements of these cells in rat medial prefrontal cortex were strikingly similar to true pyramidal neurones seen in Golgi preparations (see especially Fig.
15737062	244	Because the highly influential, strong, and reliable (Figure S8) synaptic connections in the network are few in number, their exact connectivity pattern and properties might therefore be important and make firing patterns of the involved cortical neurons highly reproducible.
8459275	178	Membrane properties of the two classes of nonpyramidal cells Resting membrane potentials of fast-spiking nonpyramidal cells were more negative than those of low-threshold spike cells (Table 1).
17122323	248	Gray lines and points show data from individual neurons.
21753015	255	crossed-corticostriatal cells extended their collaterals more locally near their somata than did corticopontine cells cells.
22002739	451	However, in the rodent somatosensory cortex, still a great number of subplate neurons remain into adulthood (Al-Ghoul and Miller 1989; Woo et al. 1991; Valverde et al. 1995; Robertson et al. 2000; Arias et al. 2002; Heuer et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2011).
15987765	191	This classification mostly relies on the axonal arborization of these cells because the dendritic morphology is less discriminating across interneurons (Fairen et al. 1984).
10634900	52	Experiments were interrupted whenever the access resistance to the postsynaptic neuron increased significantly.

18971461	197	We compared the common input probabilities between connected and unconnected cell pairs, respectively separately in pairs, respectively consisting of cells of the same (homo) and different (hetero) L5 subtypes.
20927409	379	Frozen noise allows the study of spike responses independently of any stimulus-independent property of a neuron [3,79].
22798946	69	Axon fibers from neurons in the anterior part of posteromedial target preferentially layer 5A of somatosensory while those from neurons in the posterior part were predominantly found in layer 1 (Ohno et al., 2011).
19805321	179	The distributions of synapse numbers for pairs of synaptically coupled neurons forming layer 4 to layer 2/3, L53 L5, and L43 L4 projections were measured in a series of studies performed in the Sakmann group (21–23).
22171028	332	This may be one of the reasons why strong L4-to-CTN connections have been reported only infrequently by previous photostimulation or multiple whole-cell recording studies.
15456817	257	Here, we can give a more detailed account by adding the number of synapses that is formed by the different neurons of a given cell type with an individual neuron (adding the numbers in each row of Fig.
22427971	101	We carried out dual whole-cell patch clamp recordings from the dendrites and somata in layers 6, 5 b (thick-tufted cells) & 2/3 in the somatosensory neocortex of rats (see Table 1 for detailed experimental parameters).
17898147	394	Intrinsic circuitry and physiological properties of pyramidal neurons in rat barrel cortex.

21286222	54	At 24–26°C, four neurons adopted strong burst spiking patterns, with bursts of 2–4 spikes.
17898147	234	A similar distinction in adaptation has previously been reported for RS1 and RS2 cells (Agmon and Connors 1992), although RS1 cells did not exhibit large spike afterpotentials as we will later show for corticothalamic and corticotrigeminal neurons.

21917809	281	We assumed that 80% of neurons were excitatory and 20% were inhibitory (Beaulieu et al., 1992) and that one-quarter of the inhibitory neurons were parvalbumin-positive in S2/3 (Xu et al., 2010).
21118703	412	Three-dimensional neuron tracing by voxel scooping.
21753015	343	For a similar U, corticopontine cells/corticopontine cells connections exhibited higher paired-pulse ratios than CCC/crossed-corticostriatal connections.
22171028	338	Visualizing CTN dendrites, we observed that corticothalamic projection neurons formed apical dendritic bundles (Fig. 9 E, F ) and that the interbundle interval was 56 14 m (mean SD).
15456817	120	The cells were classified into conventionally recognized cell types, which are defined according to anatomical features such as the laminar location of the cell body, whether the dendrites are smooth or spiny, and the branching characteristics of the axonal and dendritic trees (O'Leary, 1941; Lorente de No ́ , 1949; Szentagothai, 1973; Szentagothai and Arbib, 1974; Lund et al., 1979; Ramon y Cajal, 1988).
16467534	134	B, Onset latency of axonal Voltage-sensitive dye signals relative to the somatic response (0 m) tude were similar in neurons with axonal plotted against distance from the axon hillock for the data in A.
9880578	81	In cells where the mIPSC frequency was low enough, 30–100 miniature IPSCs were selected, with no overlap with other minis.
15539396	39	A third amplifier was used in the whole-cell configuration to stimulate presynaptic pyramidal neurones in layer 2/3.
22798946	200	However, it is likely that a connections between layer 4 spiny neurons and layer 6 with pyramidal neurons exist as the the strong axonal arborization of the layer 6 with axon suggests (Pichon et al., 2012).
17898147	116	Injections of retrograde tracers are likely to cover only a fraction of a projection's target area and are therefore unlikely to label all neurons projecting to that area.
21368112	106	To relate the obtained 3D axon projection patterns to innervation densities that may allow speculating on synaptic connectivity, we determined the distance between boutons (N = 956) along axons in dysgranular, supragranular, infragranular, and granular regions for slender- and thick-tufted neurons (n = 4), respectively.
9880578	130	Moreover, the input resistance of the cells and the noise level of the recordings were not changed by zolpidem.
18466749	28	Here, we show that, in fast-spiking cells, AP threshold is additionally regulated by a specific K+ channel (a Kv1 channel) via a dynamic interaction with Na+ channels.
22002739	118	Besides, there was a delay before the onset of spike train in regular spiking subplate neurons (arrow in Fig.
15525762	308	Altogether, cumulative evidence including our results indicates that electrical synapses are formed between functionally similar GABAergic interneurons.
21704132	76	At that point, positive pressure was lowered to 30 mm Hg and cells were searched for in voltage clamp mode.
19759293	215	Somatodendritic electrical signaling into axons In cerebellar stellate cells, NMDA receptor-mediated depolarizations subthreshold for action potential initiation spread electrotonically from the dendrite into the axon opening voltage-sensitive Ca 2 channels in varicosities (Christie and Jahr, 2008).
22171028	343	A recent study has further reported that activation of the barrel column enhances the sensory responses of relay neurons in the corresponding thalamic compartment, or barreloid (Temereanca and Simons, 2004).
10980023	558	Intrinsic firing patterns and whisker-evoked synaptic responses of neurons in the rat barrel cortex.
17898147	312	However, the fast afterhyperpolarizations and DAPs of corticothalamic neurons were significantly larger and their firing thresholds were significantly more negative than corticotrigeminal neurons.

18466749	20	The molecular basis of this dampening influence on fast-spiking cell excitability is the spatially delimited expression of specific K+ channels at the fast-spiking cell axon initial segment, such that these channels have a profound but restricted influence on near-threshold excitability and AP threshold.
17334362	76	There are two possible explanations for the stronger excitatory conductances observed in FS cells: (i) greater numbers of thalamic ventrobasal thalamus cells might contact each FS cell and/or (in vivo,) the unitary synaptic connections from ventrobasal thalamus to FS cells could be stronger than those from ventrobasal thalamus to RS cells.

22114282	209	The same data are presented as an x–y error plot (Fig. 5A, right), which summarizes the main findings described above: (1) layer 5 contains the two populations of output pyramidal neurons whose action potential activity responses are the most and the least binocular along a V1: 5TPs (green) and 5NPs (blue), respectively; (2) 2/3Ps (black) and 5TPs (green) are similarly binocular at the postsynaptic potential level but produce action potential activity responses that are highly and scarcely binocular, respectively (note the similar postsynaptic potential-ocular dominance index error but the threefold larger action potential activity-ocular dominance index error of 2/3Ps).

15737062	292	In conclusion, the statistics of connectivity in a local network of layer 5 tufted pyramidal neurons are highly nonrandom and bear similarities to other biological networks.
19805321	68	To model such cooperative synapse formation, we introduced a monotonically increasing function, f(numbers, AIM), which is the probability that a cell pair, initially connected with numbers, AIM synapses, will remain synaptically coupled.
17898147	322	It is therefore possible in SI that these patterns of firing are distinct and only found in discrete subpopulations of projection neurons where the latter pattern of firing is observed in corticothalamic and -trigeminal neurons and, as in the visual cortex, burst firing is exhibited by corticotectal and -pontine neurons.

17698015	282	In addition to cell specificity, our data indicate that synapse location in the axonal arbor influences the ability of somatic steady-state depolarizations to enhance uEPSP amplitude (Figure 8), with this effect being greatest for the most proximal synapses.

16369481	184	Neurons isolated from two different cortical regions in a single transgenic line showed similar laminar distribution, morphology and firing properties.
9880578	328	The deactivation kinetics of currents evoked by GABA applications on outside-out patches is much slower than that of miniature IPSCs (this study; Tia et al., 1996; Galarreta and Hestrin, 1997; Jones and Westbrook, 1997) and is voltage independent, unlike that of miniature I PSC s in the same cells (Salin and Prince, 1996).
9236245	219	The small number of corticocortical cells found in lamina V I in these retrograde transport studies could result from the fact that the injections sites did not span across the whole thickness of the cortex and/or from the sparse arborization of lamina VI afferents in these regions.
9592109	222	In such a case, any suppression of complex cell response tuning could be attributed to either the removal of input from external oriented subunits such as simple cells or to the loss of nonlinear intradendritic processing needed to compute the subunits locally, or both.
8574660	69	In the insets "~'2, B'~, C'~, and D~, the first derivative of an individual ( v ) action potential is shown, which demonstrates that action potentials are faster in in bursting and non-adapting regular spiking neurons neurons compared to adapting regular spiking neurons neurons.

21368112	181	Second, nearsimultaneous activation of layer 5 slender-tufted and VPM pathways during sensory-motor behavioral paradigms, such as object location during active whisking, may coincidentally depolarize basal and apical dendrites of layer 5 thick-tufted neurons and cause increased (i.e., burst) activity (Fig. 7C) (37, 53), which is then conveyed to intra- and subcortical targets.
17317752	327	Most strikingly, the majority of APs are emitted during the 10–20 ms after the stimulus, and most of these were emitted by L5 thick-tufted cells.
9236245	158	Second, lamina V I of the rat primary somatosensory area contains a large number of neurons that, despite their apparent morphological diversity, are all involved in corticocortical relationships.
17698015	224	This hypothesis was tested by correlating the effect of steady-state depolarization on uEPSP amplitude with the location of putative synaptic contacts identified after filling pre- and postsynaptic neurons with biocytin and subsequent 3D reconstruction (Figure 8A).
14645486	300	This difference may be attributable to the higher proportion of parvalbumin than calretinin and somatostatin neurons (Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1997), the large dendritic tree of parvalbumin neurons (Wang et al., 2002), and/or a denser innervation of individual parvalbumin neurons (Gulya ́ s et al., 1999).
8459275	392	In contrast, dendrites of high input-resistance cells distributed much more extensively in deep layers (640 t 60 pm, n = 7) than in superficial layers ( 100 t 60 pm, n = 7).
11826166	3	The percentage of failures of an AP in a layer 4 spiny neurone to evoke a unitary EPSP in the L2/3 pyramidal cell was 4.9 ± 8.8 % and the coefficient of variation (c.v.) of the unitary EPSP amplitude was 0.27 ± 0.13.

21286222	98	In individual neurons, cooling to 24–26°C could cause depolarization of up to 10 mV and hyperpolarization of up to 9 mV.
17122323	98	Once washed, cells were visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX60).
15182718	135	Thus, our analysis reveals that the spatial distribution of excitatory synaptic input from layer 2/3 to layer 2/3 neurons is initially very local and broadens with development Aps distance from soma neurons selectively gain input from more distant regions.

9007187	891	Cortical modules are defined as narrow, vertically aligned columns of neurones that share overlapping functional properties (Peters, 1993).
16369481	105	This degree of heterogeneity could not be previously appreciated because most previous cell type–specific gene expression studies monitored levels of only one or a few genes.
21917809	133	If the photostimulation of a positive cell generated a synaptic response in the PC with a GABAergic reversal potential (set to 80 mV), we identified them as true positive, i.e., a putatively connected neuron, since it was time-locked to the optical stimulation of an inhibitory cell (Fig. 2 B, red box).
17317752	95	Cells that were located in the cytochrome oxidase dense volume were categorized as layer 4 cells.

15987765	364	Surprisingly, several chandelier cells displayed some features reminiscent of late spiking cells (Fig. 12, E and F), although all chandelier interneurons still matched with fast-spiking cluster.
8459275	305	low-threshold spike cells, by contrast, extend axons more vertically up to layer I and in some cases also to deep layers.
9592109	76	For vertical orientation tuning, the three vertically aligned groups of 64 cells, with centers indicated by bolder dots, were designated as the “friends” of cell 1, i.e., they were maximally correlated with this cell for an ensemble of vertically oriented bars of optimal width.

22798946	30	However, the changes in cell density between the cortical L5A and L5B pyramidal neurons are generally gradual, particular those between layer 5 and 5B as well as 6A and 6B (for the barrel cortex see Meyer et al., 2010b).
2332787	290	Our cst~mates of combined dendritic length are greater by a factor of approximately 3 than those obtained for the basal trees of la!cr 3 and 5 pyramids by .luraska ( 1982, 1984) or for the large la!cr 5 pyramidal cells of rat sensorimotor cortex obtained by Petit et al. ( 1088).
21753015	245	Projection subtype-dependent connectivity Connection probabilities for crossed-corticostriatal to crossed-corticostriatal cell pairs and crossed-corticostriatal to corticopontine cells cell pairs are similar, but that for corticopontine cells to crossed-corticostriatal cells is much lower (Morishima and Kawaguchi, 2006).
14645486	288	Using triple immunofluorescence labeling, our results demonstrate that neurons expressing one of the three markers do not stain the other two, suggesting that parvalbumin, calretinin, and somatostatin neurons constitute distinct families.
14673000	126	Dopamine, an important neuromodulator in prefrontal cortex, has been reported to both increase (Yang and Seamans, 1996; Gorelova and Yang, 2000) and decrease (Geijo-Barrientos and Pastore, 1995; Maurice et al., 2001) sodium channel activation in prefrontal pyramidal neurons.

16093380	243	Stronger GABAergic contacts should more readily prevent regular-spiking cells from spiking during inhibitory events, effectively pushing spikes into closer temporal alignment.
17898147	261	We therefore made separate recordings from corticotrigeminal (n 15) and callosal (n 20) neurons, using picrotoxin in place of bicuculline in the bath solution.
10980023	382	An incoming thalamocortical volley may not result merely in a temporally fused slow depolarization in middle laminar pyramidal cells but, at least in some cells, may also establish preferred latencies of action potential generation at the fast oscillations frequency.
17698015	279	In contrast, in the axons examined in our study, bath application of dendrotoxin-I completely abolished facilitation of transmitter release during subthreshold somatic depolarization of the presynaptic neuron (Figure 7B), indicating that somatodendritic control of release depends solely on modulation of axonal Kv1 channels.

21451062	205	At all ages, some cells expressed both transient and persistent components to the putative Kv1-mediated current.
22002739	18	However, in rodents, a considerable amount of subplate neurons are persisted in adult brain (Al-Ghoul and Miller 1989; Woo et al. 1991; Valverde et al. 1995; Robertson et al. 2000; Arias et al. 2002; Heuer et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2011).
19295167	702	Indeed and in contrast to fast-spiking-parvalbumin and adapting somatostatin interneurons, their electrical coupling is much more complex because neurogliaform cells are not only coupled with other neurogliaform cells (Chu et al., 2003) but also with fast-spiking-parvalbumin and putative adapting somatostatin neurons (Simon et al., 2005).
10884314	178	This result suggests that the main target cells of spiny stellate cell axons are spiny neurons in layer 4 and pyramidal neurons in 2/3, implying that the flow of excitation is preferentially directed from layer 4 to layer 2/3.

20927409	53	Several factors likely contribute to making these interneurons highly specialized for the control of P spike precision, including their short membrane time constants; intrinsic excitability [15]; the presence of Kv3 potassium channels, which efficiently accelerate the repolarization of action potentials [16]; sub-millisecond AMPA receptor conductances [15,17–19]; the rapid and reliable synchronous release of GABA at their 2+ terminals [20–23]; the almost ubiquitous expression of the Cabinding protein parvalbumin in these cells; and the characteristic firing of action potentials at high constant rate with no adaptation.
21286222	25	Layer 5 pyramidal neurons were identified by their large, pyramidal somata, located 720–960 μm from the pial edge of the slice (seven neurons), their characteristic firing patterns and large apical dendritic trees, visible by fluorescence microscopy once filled with indicator.

22798946	508	Future studies are required to define the connectivity and function of the preand postsynaptic neurons in these pathways.
22798946	31	Nevertheless, some L5A and L5B pyramidal neurons are readily identifiable such a cortical L5A and L5B pyramidal neurons 1 and 4 because of their low and high cell density, respectively; this feature is even visible in unstained neocortical slices (e.g., Marx et al., 2012).

17317752	325	Under these conditions, clearly the number of APs emitted at any time, spontaneously (Fig. 8A) and after whisker deflection (Fig. 8B), is very different depending on layer and cell type and by far exceeds the number of APs that are fired in ventral posterior medial nucleus (see also Supplementary Fig.

21917809	370	Consistent with this lack of specificity in their outputs, interneurons in layer 2/3 of visual cortex are broadly tuned to the orientation of a stimulus (Sohya et al., 2007; Niell and Stryker, 2008; Kerlin et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2010; Zariwala et al., 2011), although some positive interneurons in the more superficial part of layer 2/3 appear to be sharply tuned (Runyan et al., 2010).

22593736	9	However, differences in inter-spike interval variability and spike frequency adaptation have been reported among regularly spiking pyramidal neurons and it is unclear whether these differences reflect neuron-to-neuron variablity or result from the different recording conditions employed in different studies (Agmon and Connors, 1992; Nuñez et al., 1993; Dégenètais et al., 2002; Cho et al., 2004).
17317752	387	The lowest trial-to-trial variability in cortex was observed in layer 4 cells, L5 thick-tufted cells and a subset of L6 cells, and was comparable to the response variability of ventral posterior medial nucleus cells, known to innervate these three particular regions.

21880904	32	Dendritic arbors of inhibitory interneurons have also been shown to remodel on a day-to-day basis in primary visual cortex (visual) (Lee et al., 2006), but it is unknown whether this is a general feature of cortical microcircuits across functional domains outside of visual.
17717695	269	For the barrel cortex, it has been shown (Temereanca and Simons 2004) that cortico-thalamic feedback connections from layer 6 neurons help to sharpen the spatial response properties of thalamic neurons in ventral posteromedial nucleus by recruiting topographically specific excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms.

12746859	338	Even though the size of the cell bodies did not vary significantly, the somatic shape was more similar to that of the tall pyramidal neurons included in the first main branch (group 1; for example, somatic roundness, 0.63 0.11 for group 1 vs. 0.59 0.07 for group 3, n 23; P 0.01) rather to the short pyramidal cells described in group 2 (somatic roundness, 0.71 0.08 for group 2 vs. group 3; P 0.0001).
20927409	296	One presynaptic fast-spiking interneuron is synaptically connected to itself and to a postsynaptic P neuron (PYR).

18971461	28	Physiologically, cells firing burst of multiple spikes and regular spiking cells firing trains of single spikes during current pulse injection have been described (Connors et al., 1982; McCormick et al., 1985; Agmon and Connors, 1992; Cho et al., 2004).

22114282	12	Introduction Connectivity of pyramidal neurons is layer specific in primary visual cortex (V1) (Burkhalter, 1989; Thomson and Bannister, 2003), and this is reflected in laminar differences of their response properties (Martinez et al., 2005; Niell and Stryker, 2008; Medini, 2011).
9236245	88	These cells do not give rise to long ascending branches and most of their terminations are restricted to lamina VI (B, D).
17898147	256	To test this possibility, we repeated these analyses in a subset of cells that were held at a membrane potential of – 65 mV, including corticothalamic (n 9), corticotrigeminal (n 9), corticostriatal (n 16), and callosal (n 7) neurons.

19151697	1	The dendrites of individual cortical neurons overlap with numerous types of local and long-range excitatory axons, but axodendritic overlap is not always a good predictor of actual connection strength3–5.

15987765	343	The fastest action potentials in fast-spiking interneurons along with their other properties (i.e., fast presynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials [EPSPs] and postsynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials [IPSPs]) may well serve the purpose of quick delivery of the perisomatic inhibitiory effects on the excitatory responses in the postsynaptic pyramidal cells.

22514308	538	Recurrent excitation amplifies spiking in local networks (Compte et al., 2003) and has been proposed to amplify afferent input to layer 4 (Douglas et al., 1995). layer 4 provides strong feedforward input to layer 2/3 (Lu ̈ bke et al., 2003; Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005), and the probability that two layer 2/3 neurons are connected is higher when they share a common input from layer 4 (Yoshimura et al., 2005).

9007187	909	Since cortical interneurones can strongly influence the activity of large populations of pyramidal cells, afferent input to GABAergic neurones in medial prefrontal cortex could influence (either by feedforward intracortical inhibition or disinhibition) widespread populations of cortical projection cells.
10884314	15	Most of these neurons resemble spiny stellate cells, whereas a smaller fraction has been described as star pyramidal cells (Lund, 1984; Ahmed et al., 1994; Hirsch, 1995).
12746859	165	(4) Somatic axes ratio, i.e., the ratio of the somatic axis along the direction of the cell (vectorial average of the circular distribution of dendrites) to the longest perpendicular axis.
15456817	321	The histogram of the number of synapses that are formed between cell types and individual neurons (Fig. 11 B) shows that for many of these, the synaptic numbers are rather low (i.e., “weak projections”) and only a few are very high (i.e., “strong projections”).
15525762	66	Layer II/III pyramidal cells were selected on the basis of their characteristic dendrosomatic appearance and regular spiking pattern of firing (McCormick et al., 1985).
9453672	112	Anterograde horseradish peroxidase terminal labeling was observed in all cortical areas in which cells labeled by retrograde transport from layer I of shown in C were found.
22593736	81	In an earlier study of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, we classified neurons as bursting or regularly firing based on the variation in inter-spike interval during a depolarizing current pulse at the soma, with neurons characterized as regularly spiking if none of the inter-spike intervals differed more by than 15% from the mean inter-spike interval and bursting if any inter-spike interval differed from the mean by 15% or more (Hedrick and Waters, 2011).
22798946	347	L5A and L5B pyramidal neurons may interact in the following way according to a hypothesis put forward by Oberlaender and coworkers (Oberlaender et al., 2011a): Slender-tufted (L5A) pyramidal neurons have been shown to carry information on the motion and phase of the vibrissae during active whisking but show little if any action potential firing activity after passive touch (Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009; de Kock and Sakmann, 2009).
17317752	380	Cell-type-specific sensory representation We showed that in L5, representation of the sensory stimulus is cell-type-specific.

12695107	126	This can be overcome by inverting the sample and imaging the neuron from the other side.
9592109	86	Thus, the axodendritic contact of each ON-center cell in the LGN population was flanked at a distance of either 20 μm or 100 μm (in one control run) by connections from other ON-center cells in the same vertical strip and /or from OFF-center cells in horizontally offset vertical strips.

18216227	391	Laminar sources of synaptic input to cortical inhibitory interneurons and pyramidal neurons.
16793907	357	The different synaptic connections are colour coded: intracortical connections are in red, violet and green; the thalamocortical inputs are drawn in dark blue (from VPM) B, innervation domains (80% contour lines) for the three types of excitatory synaptic connections in which layer 2/3 pyramidal cells are the postsynaptic (target) neurones (layer 4–layer 2/3 connection, red; layer 2/3–layer 2/3 connection, violet; L5A–layer 2/3 connection, green).
22798946	121	(A) Most thalamic afferents from ventral posterior medial nucleus nucleus of the thalamus arborize extensively in layer 4 in a barrel-restricted fashion, (B) layer 4 spiny stellate cell, (C) layer 4 star pyramidal cell, (D) corticothalamically projecting L6A pyramidal cell.
15987765	341	Perisomatic inhibition is thought to regulate synchronous and oscillatory activity of large populations of pyramidal cells (McBain and Fishan 2001; Somogyi and Klausberger 2005).
10884314	258	This classification was possible because the oblique coronal plane of sectioning allowed discrimination of spiny stellate and star pyramidal neurons in contrast to the tangential plane used in Golgi studies (Pasternak and Woolsey, 1975; Woolsey et al., 1975; Steffen, 1976; Simons and Woolsey, 1984).
21451062	193	A: soma diameter did not change significantly with age for the recorded cells.
19759293	23	In contrast to GABAergic stellate cell interneurons in the cerebellum, pyramidal cells in neocortical layer 5 of visual cortex release glutamate, are primary projection neurons, and have extensive axonal arbors spanning multiple cortical layers.
22114282	252	I directly measured the changes of visually driven synaptic inputs and spike outputs of granular (n 11) and supragranular (n 11) pyramidal neurons during brief monocular deprivation.

14602839	267	Together, these results suggest that the amount of depolarization required for spike generation, and thus the responsiveness of a neuron, is a constant during development.
22427971	71	After recordings, slices were fixed and stained as described previously [14] for later reconstruction of the investigated neurons.
22171028	293	Discussion Here, we estimated local excitatory inputs to corticothalamic projection neurons (Figs.
15456817	9	There have long been effective techniques for revealing the projection pathways (i.e., the entire dendritic and axonal trees) of individual neurons and now increasingly sophisticated labeling methods can be applied to reveal groups of neurons in the circuit with common characteristics, like the same neurotransmitter, or that they project to the same nucleus.
22171028	148	When we compared all pairs between the six pyramidal/spiny neuron groups (15 comparisons) we used Peritz's F test (Harper, 1984), a multiple-comparison test (Tables 2, 3; see Figs.
22114282	283	As shown in the plots of Figure 6, most cells remained strongly dominated by the closed (contralateral) eye inputs in monocular deprivation rats (9 of 11 in monocular deprivation rats vs 11 of 12 in controls).
17317752	18	We thus wanted to estimate the average action potential response to a whisker deflection of the cells within a column and the relative contribution of the anatomically defined cell types at different times after stimulus onset.
22514308	558	Thicktufted pyramidal cells in L5B also project within layer 5 and to neighboring columns (Schubert et al., 2001; Larsen et al., 2007; Oberlaender et al., 2011).
9570781	234	This is substantially lower than most recent estimates of resistivity (Shelton, 1985; Stratford et al., 1989; C auller and Connors, 1992; Fromherz and Muller, 1994; Major et al., 1994; Rapp et al., 1994; Thurbon et al., 1994; Bekkers and Stevens, 1996; Meyer et al., 1997) and more in line with the value used by early investigators of the passive properties of CNS neurons (Coombs et al., 1959; Rall, 1959; L ux et al., 1970; Barrett and Crill, 1974), and that recently obtained in spinal motoneurons (Thurbon et al., 1998) It has been recognized for some time that better estimates of membrane properties such as resistivity will require voltage measurement at two points (or more) on the same neuron, especially if membrane properties are nonuniform (Holmes and Rall, 1992).
10884314	159	Putative autaptic contacts between axon and dendrites of the presynaptic cell are marked with blue triangles.
9570781	119	These findings suggest that there was no significant effect of whole-cell recording on input resistance or Ih.
9457640	321	Regenerative activity in apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in neocortex.
14673000	215	Here, we show that the apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex are also capable of supporting active action potential backpropagation, suggesting that action potential backpropagation may be a common feature of all pyramidal neurons.
18466749	31	We show additionally that the very same K+ channel that controls AP threshold in fast-spiking cells also regulates the discharge pattern of fast-spiking cells in response to near-threshold depolarizations and thereby accounts for at least some of the firing pattern diversity observed within the fast-spiking cell class.
15772358	57	Given the extensive subthreshold receptive fields of barrel cortex neurons (Moore and Nelson, 1998; Zhu and Connors, 1999; Brecht and Sakmann, 2002; Brecht et al., 2003; Higley and Contreras, 2003), a minimum of six whiskers was tested for each cell.
14960603	212	Data are taken from the cell pair shown in Figure 9A.
16701210	275	After loading the cell for w20 min, the slow IPSP component was inhibited, and the remaining fast component was observed (red trace).
15525762	105	The average coefficient of variation of the ISI in traces containing 10 or more spikes was 0.58 0.05 (n 21 cells) (Fig. 2C).
19295167	264	The axon of the multipolar fast-spiking-parvalbumin cells was basically restricted to their home layer with an overall configuration being compatible with basket cells (Fig. 1 B, a4, a5) (Kawaguchi, 1995; Wang et al., 2002) but not with chandelier cells (Kawaguchi, 1995).

11826166	236	The postsynaptic neurone was held at a membrane potential of _60 mV.
22514308	198	Across the population, cells recorded at the site of up-state initiation (i.e., responding within 20 ms of ventrobasal stimulation) revealed monosynaptic latencies in layer 4 (3.0 1.9 ms; n 43 cells, n 37 slices), while response latency in layer 2/3 was significantly longer (7.7 4.7 ms; n 20 cells, n 20 slices) (mean SD; p 0.001, Wilcoxon's rank test).
19641119	13	Only 20 to 30% of neocortical neurons are GABAergic interneurons (Beaulieu and Somogyi, 1990; DeFelipe, 1993) with locally concentrated axons.
21753015	9	In addition to layer-specific extracortical projection patterns, it has recently become evident that individual cortical layers contain multiple pyramidal cell subtypes with different axonal targets (Molna ́r and Cheung, 2006) and distinct intracortical connections (Morishima and Kawaguchi, 2006; Le Be ́ et al., 2007; Brown and Hestrin, 2009; Sato and Svoboda, 2010).
22593736	159	Neurons were grouped according to spike pattern, with adapting, weak bursting, and regular spiking patterns in pink, green, and orange, respectively.

19295167	243	In addition, cluster 2.2.1 contained the majority of adapting neurons (61%), whereas cluster 2.2.2 contained the large majority of bursting neurons (88%) and all delayed neurons, suggesting that both clusters are composed of different populations and can be further subdivided (Fig. 1 A).
17898147	77	Cortical projection neurons were identified by their content of fluorescent RetroBeads and laminar position.
10980023	340	Over longer distances, synchronization of Fast spiking cells may be chemically mediated.
17122323	396	Although an exhaustive investigation of phasic acetylcholine responses in every variety of neocortical neuron is beyond the scope of this paper, our results reveal several general features of cholinergic modulation of the neocortex, including cell-type-, layer-, and region-specific effects of cholinergic receptor activation.
14960603	3	Repetitive action potentials (10 –15 action potentials at 50 Hz) evoked in a layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron gave rise to facilitating unitary EPSPs in the bitufted cell.
21286222	167	The temperature–sensitivity of spiking patterns observed here might help explain the disparity in the proportion of neurons classified as bursting by different authors.
17898147	140	Retrogradely labeled corticothalamic neurons were found in lower layer V and layer VI, whereas corticotrigeminal neurons were found exclusively in lower layer V (Fig. 1A).
9236245	103	This cell ramifies locally in lamina VI and gives off two axonal branches that project to the second somatosensory area.
16267239	140	Removal of cadmium from the bath partially rescued the cholinergic response in four of these neurons (mean response after wash, 1.7 0.9 mV; n 5).
18216227	28	Here, we describe a new application of two-photon photolysis of caged glutamate that enabled us to induce an action potential in only a small number (about five) of pyramidal neurons by increasing the volume of two-photon excitation by reducing the effective numerical aperture of the objective.

22002739	365	12 Correlation analysis of parameters of developing subplate neurons The correlations of electrophysiological and morphological parameters of developing subplate neurons were analyzed.
17698015	142	Local block of axon initial segment Kv1 channels in the presynaptic neuron increased uEPSP amplitude on average 1.13 ± 0.05-fold (Figure 4F; p < 0.05, n = 6).
21753015	180	quantal current size of corticopontine cells/corticopontine cells was significantly larger than those of crossed-corticostriatal/crossed-corticostriatal and crossed-corticostriatal/corticopontine cells.
21917809	141	Even positive interneurons that were very close to each other could be disambiguated, as evidenced by the complete lack of response (Fig. 2 B, cell 5; F ) from cells directly adjacent to true positive connected cells (Fig. 2 A, gray arrow vs red arrow).
19759293	237	The most sensitive method for detecting functional NMDA receptors in layer 5 pyramidal cells is optical monitoring of Ca 2 influx through NMDA receptors.
16369481	112	Overrepresented biological processes (Supplemen-400 tary Note) also included categories associated 0 with cell-cell communication.

12456830	40	To assess the excitability of the neurones and to block voltagedependent calcium channels with divalent cations, ACSFs of different compositions were used.
18971461	6	Dual recordings from L5 pyramidal cells revealed that common input probability that two L5 cells share inputs from a L2/3 cell was high in cell pairs, respectively of the same subtypes, compared with those in different subtype pairs, respectively.
12759179	4	When electric stimuli were delivered within the same layer as the recorded cell, excitatory postsynaptic potentials could be evoked up to 2000 mm away for both layers 2/3 and 5 pyramids.
19641119	190	We recorded 28 putative cells ( p 0.02, n 18 and p 0.01, n 20; permutation test).
15525762	29	To date, targeting cannabinoid receptor-1-expressing cells for systematic study has been difficult, and their physiology, morphology, and synaptic properties remain unknown.
22002739	124	Somata of subplate neurons are horizontally arranged in relation to the white matter.
20927409	76	fast-spiking cells are self-innervated to a great extent by GABAergic autapses [22,34] that control the spike-timing precision and firing dynamics of these neurons [35].
7904301	367	Sink sink, which was present in some slices in lower layer V, had a time course similar to that of sink, and thus it may reflect, primarily, another disynaptic pathway from cells in superficial layers to the dendrites of pyramidal cells in lower layer V and in layer VI.
19641119	162	The larger proportion of phase-modulated pyramidal cells compared with previously reported experiments in freely moving rats (Sirota et al., 2008) might be the result of a more stereotyped synchronization of theta oscillations under anesthesia, or different recording sites in different cortical layers or prefrontal subfields, or a different discrimination between putative pyramidal cells and interneurons.
14960603	53	Bitufted and pyramidal neurons were filled via somatic recording pipettes containing 250 M fura-2 and 400 M mag-fura-2, respectively, unless stated otherwise (all dyes are from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for at least 10 min before recording.
15987765	276	This cell was mapped into the intermediate-spiking cells cluster.
17122323	217	Together these data suggest that cholinergic inhibition in layer 5 pyramidal neurons is generated close to the somata of these cells.
17334362	177	The models were constructed kinetics (latencies and shapes) between the two model cells while using passive membrane properties and synaptic conductances derived directly from our experimental measurements (that is, the average values from the experiments; Methods, Supplementary Fig.
17334362	132	Nevertheless, the functional inhibition produced in RS cells is likely to be stronger because the resting input conductances of FS cells are fivefold higher than those of RS cells (Fig. 1c,d, discussed below).
9453672	155	The function of backward corticocortical projections must be considered within the context of these inputs that converge in layer I upon the distinct population of pyramidal neurons with distal apical tufts extending to the surface.

18305253	103	Of 28 connected pairs, 17 were discarded because one cell was lost before the experiment was completed or because of significant run-down iMK-801, no TBOA baseline transmission.
14960603	258	The sents a fitted Gaussian function with a postsynaptic neuron responded with two EPSPs, but only during one was a postsynaptic Ca 2 signal also measured (lower half-width of 5 m.
21917809	163	In all areas, the probability of connection was remarkably high in the local range and inversely proportional to intersomatic distance between the positive interneuron and the PC (Fig. 4 E).
22002739	117	With suprathreshold current injection, repetitive action potentials with little or no adaptation in firing frequency were elicited by regular spiking subplate neurons and the firing frequency increased with injected current (Fig. 2a, b).
17334362	283	Cells were visualized with infrared differential interference contrast and fluorescence microscopy.
19641119	321	Neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex might be driven by monosynaptic inputs form ventral hippocampus during theta oscillations Anatomical studies revealed that pyramidal cells and parvalbumin basket cells in the medial prefrontal cortex receive monosynaptic input from the ventral CA1 and subiculum (Swanson, 1981; Jay and Witter, 1991; Gabbott et al., 2002).
9007187	261	There is a conspicuous decline in cell density between layer 6b and the underlying white matter (Fig. 2A,C).
22514308	562	Although layer 2/3 cells also project within supragranular layers (Feldmeyer et al., 2006), properties of these connections may limit their ability to propagate up-states.
9007187	560	Class 1 cells were the most frequently encountered type of Parvalbumin-immunoreacted neurone (Fig. 12).
7904301	395	Previous studies have demonstrated that layer V cells in the motor cortex extend long-range horizontal collaterals in layer V and, to a lesser extent, in layer VI (Ghosh et al. 1988; Ghosh and Porter 1988; Landry et al. 1980).
17898147	144	Using stereological techniques, we counted the total number of neurons in layer V that were labeled with retrogradely labeled corticothalamic, green, or both retrogradely labeled corticothalamic and green Retrobeads.
15987765	287	Chandelier interneurons, although all fast-spiking, in several instances displayed late spiking features with a prominent depolarization ramp and initial spikes generated at the end of the sweeps evoked with low-stimulation current (Fig. 12, E and F), whereas at high-stimulus currents these cells fired from the beginning of the sweep without significant spike frequency adaptation.

21368112	117	As the two neuron types in layer 5 are differentially involved in whisker motion or passive whisker touch (Fig.
11731554	307	In rabbits, sectioning the corpus callosum at birth led to the loss of dendritic spines that were restricted to the oblique branches of the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in the adult animals, suggesting a distinct anatomical locus for the bulk of the callosal input onto these neurons (Globus and Scheibel 1967).
10195309	100	As described in vivo (see Discussion), layer IV pyramidal and inverted pyramidal neurons also contributed to this inter-areal connection.
19914188	203	Furthermore, inhibitory inputs have been reported stronger onto L2/3 Pyramidal cells than layers Pyramidal cells (van Brederode and Spain, 1995), with thick layers Pyramidal cells—for which we observed the densest activity—receiving weaker inhibition than slender Pyramidal cells (Hefti and Smith, 2000).
15217339	14	Similarly, the inhibitory neurons show characteristic morphology and patterns of connections throughout the neocortex.
11826166	321	B–E, putative synaptic and F, autaptic contacts made by axon collaterals of layer 4 cells on dendrites of L2/3 pyramidal cells.
17898147	250	The threshold for action potential generation is also significantly more negative in corticothalamic and corticotrigeminal neurons than in callosal and corticostriatal neurons (Table 1; P 0.05, Scheffe post hoc comparison).
9453672	185	B: The application of Diamidino yellow to layer I in the forepaw area of shown in C (4 mm lateral and 0 mm posterior to Bregma) labeled cells immediately below, excluding layer IV (this site in the forepaw area was verified by recording the response to contralateral forepaw stimulation).
2332787	257	We also recovered a singlecell with twin apical trunks,whichhadsomefeaturesincommonwithboththeother classesand, in our opinion, could not be readily included with either.
17122323	101	Non-fast-spiking neurons were classified into two groups based on the presence or absence of a hyperpolarization-activated cationic current (“I ”), measured using long (1.5 s) hyperpolarizing current injections h that produced a peak hyperpolarization of 30 mV from the resting potential (mean change in membrane potential, V , was 29 8; M n 62).
10884314	122	Combined bright-field and infrared-differential interference contrast videomicroscopy at low and high magnification, respectively, showed that the somata of neurons appeared to be organized in clusters of 5–15 neurons (Fig. 1 B, C), with a predominant location at the edges of individual barrels.
21368112	91	With respect to layer-specific innervation profiles, thick-tufted neurons were also significantly different from slender-tufted neurons (Fig. 5C).
12037194	354	The encounter of an object on the 6th whisking cycle is simulated by evoking action potentials in a different set of 25 neurons (right panels).
17122323	287	However, because the sole previous report of cholinergic inhibition of fast-spiking cells examined neurons in the visual cortex from young (12- to 17-day old) Sprague-Dawley rats (Xiang et al. 1998), it is possible that cholinergic inhibition of fast-spiking cells is age or animal strain dependent.
9236245	73	Deep in lamina V I, close to the white matter, a light plexus of fibers about 100 μm thick divides lamina V I in two parts, the upper part constituting lamina V Ia and the lower narrow stratum of cells constituting lamina VIb.

19474331	119	mRNA was harvested from manually sorted GFPexpressing neurons dissociated from acutely prepared brain slices at a range of developmental time points (postnatal day 7, postnatal day 10, P15, P25, and P40) and subsequently reverse transcribed, amplified, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix 430 2.0 whole-genome microarrays (three microarrays from three different animals per condition).
19295167	90	A complex spike amplitude accommomin dation during a train of action potentials, consisting in a transient decrease of spikes amplitude, preeminent in some cortical neurons, was measured as the difference between the peak of the smallest action potential and the peak of the following biggest action potential (Cauli et al., 2000).
17334362	56	All tested cells, RS and FS, received thalamic excitation.

22002739	177	For the membrane time constant (s, tau) of subplate neurons, the developmental change was evident (Fig. 3c).
9007187	702	The total numbers of calretinin+, Parvalbumin+, calbindin D-28k+, and g-aminobutyric acid+ neurones under 1 mm2 of cortical surface of areas 25, 32 and 24b are given in Tables 5, 6 and 7, respectively.
14645486	193	This proportion is almost an order of magnitude higher than of feedback inputs to calretinin neurons in layer 2/3 (Fig. 4 A).
17698015	214	Taken together, these results suggest that somatic depolarization of the presynaptic neuron acts via inactivation of Kv1 channels to increase axonal AP duration and thereby enhance transmitter release at layer 5 synapses.
22114282	316	Binocularity of single cells was computed as the absolute value of (C I)/(C I), where C and I are the amplitudes of action potential activity responses to contralateral and ipsilateral eye stimulation, respectively.
17317752	144	Layer 5 slender-tufted cells were characterized by low evoked action potential responses and longer latency to response onset, whereas L5 thick-tufted cells mostly responded with short latencies and higher action potential responses.
17698015	195	(E) Long subthreshold depolarizations (10 s, $300 pA) applied to the soma during simultaneous somatic (thin) and axonal (thick) whole-cell recordings.

9457640	35	No correction was made for the junction cortical pyramidal neurons (Deschenes, 1981; Pockberger, potential between bath and pipette solutions, which was 1991; Kim & Connors, 1993; Regehr, Kehoe, Ascher & experimentally determined to be -12 mV.

14602839	231	This is comparable with those observed in layer I interneurons in the rat neocortex (Zhou and Hablitz 1996) and in deep layer pyramidal neurons in the mouse neocortex (Picken Bahrey and Moody 2003).
22798946	354	These connections, which may be the cortical relay of a thalamocorticothalamic feedback loop, have been characterized in more detail: Thalamocortically projecting L5B pyramidal cells form giant large diameter (2–8 μm) presynaptic terminals and establish glutamatergic synapses (containing Ca2+-permeable AMPA and NMDA receptors) with posteromedial relay neurons (Hoogland et al., 1987, 1991; Bourassa et al., 1995; Groh et al., 2008; Liao et al., 2010).

16267239	100	Previous studies demonstrating Acetylcholine-mediated hyperpolarization of neocortical pyramidal neurons during application of high concentrations of Acetylcholine ( 10 mM) have suggested that the inhibitory actions of Acetylcholine are mediated by GABAergic synaptic transmission (McCormick and Prince, 1985, 1986).

21753015	142	The dendritic parameters of three divisions AB2251, Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents) in Tris-buffered saline containing were compared between L5a and layer 5b (Fig. 1 B–D). 10% normal goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.04% Triton corticopontine cells cells had more elaborate and vertically compact basal X-100 overnight at 4°C.
8459275	395	The two categories of nonpyramidal cells recognized here are as follows: fast-spiking nonpyramidal cells, which are aspiny and fire repetitively by synaptic activation when in a depolarized state; and low-threshold spike nonpyramidal cells, which are moderately spiny and show no tendency to repetitive firing by synaptic activation even when in a depolarized state.
14602839	326	A previous study has shown that layer II/III of the rat medial prefrontal cortex is still poorly differentiated at P6, being composed of neurons with a large nucleus and little cytoplasm (Van Eden and Uylings 1985).
22171028	102	Five neurons from each of L2/3, L4, L5b, L6 green fluorescent protein-positive (L6 ), and L6 GFPnegative (L6 ) groups and three neurons from L5a group were analyzed (see also Results).
8459275	385	Morphological difirences in the two classes of pyramidal cells ' Although axonal distributions of pyramidal cells could not be revealed in their entirety because of weaker staining of the axons than in nonpyramidal cells, certain morphological characteristics of the dendrites tended to correlate with the two groups of pyramidal cells (Fig. 15).
8459275	636	Comparative electrophysiology of pyramidal and sparsely spiny stellate neurons of the neocortex.
16793907	349	When the number of boutons in the innervation domain is divided by the average number of synaptic contacts made in a layer 2/3-to-layer 2/3 pyramidal cell pair (∼3 contacts established per connection assuming a single release site per contact: Silver et al. 2003; Biro et al. 2005), a single layer 2/3 pyramidal cell should innervate about 300 postsynaptic neurones.
15539396	248	This action potential, recorded in the interneurone soma, was broader than that initiated at the same RMP (set to -60 mV by constant current injection) by an injection of a square-pulse somatic current (Fig. 9C).
9453672	84	Accordingly, only those surface applications that excluded cell labeling in layer IV (horseradish peroxidase, n = 10; Diamidino yellow, n = 12; FB, n = 2) were included in the following retrograde analysis of the origins of inputs to layers I/II.
17898147	169	This is consistent with the prior observation of subtypes of corticostriatal neurons, including pyramidal tract-type-type neurons that project through the pyramidal tract, and intratelencephalic or Intratelencephalic-type-type neurons that have ipsilateral projections to the striatum and cortex, but do not project callosally (Donoghue and Kitai 1981; Wilson 1987).
9592109	166	There is now solid evidence that the dendrites of neocortical pyramidal cells contain physiologically prominent concentrations of NMDA channels, which have been shown to contribute a large fraction of the excitatory synaptic drive in primary visual cortex (Miller et al., 1989; Fox et al., 1989, 1992), and voltage-dependent Na + channels capable of generating f ull-blown dendritic action potentials (Amitai et al., 1993; Kim and Connors, 1993; Stuart and Sakmann, 1994; Schiller et al., 1995; Markram et al., 1997).

19474331	4	Although embryonic transcriptional events govern the initial steps of cell-type specification in most cortical interneurons, including fast-spiking cells, the electrophysiological properties that distinguish adult cortical cell types emerge relatively late in postnatal development, and the transcriptional events that drive this maturational process are not known.

21917809	284	When restricted to a 50- m-thick slab centered on the PC, this model accurately replicated our results predicting that there would be six positive interneurons connected to the PC.
16467534	178	In addition, the oligodendrocyte process that ensheathed the proximal region of the layer 5 pyramidal neuron axon had a larger diameter (1.5 0.2 m) than other oligodendrocyte processes (1.0 0.1 m).
17122323	348	We found 12 neurons that were hyperpolarized by focal acetylcholine application (100 M, 50 ms; Fig.

17898147	165	D: using stereological techniques, we quantified the number of retrogradely labeled projection neurons and plotted them as a percent (means SE) of the total number of neurons in layer V.
19295167	188	As expected from our sampling procedure and in accordance with the literature (Jin et al., 2001), neurons were mostly radially oriented (Fig. 1 B) (see Table 8).
15115747	67	Current injection at the soma resulted in action potentials (Fig. 1B) at a similar linear frequency to current (f/I) relationship (Fig. 1C, black dots) to that already reported for L5 pyramidal neurons (Oakley et al., 2001), and produced attenuated back-propagated action potentials in the dendrite as shown previously (Stuart et al., 1997).
10884314	162	The soma of the presynaptic cell is shown in red.
22593736	125	Hence to examine changes in action potential waveforms with temperature, we pooled results from neurons with different spiking patterns (Figures 5 and 6).
19805321	399	Since the parameters of the cooperative synapse formation model are not sensitive to particular values of s (Fig. S3), the morphological differences between L5A and L5B neurons are not expected to affect the main conclusions of our work.
17122323	404	Cholinergic inhibition is not a universal feature of all pyramidal neurons, however.
22593736	12	Although pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 and layer 6 both express voltage-gated sodium and calcium conductances in the apical dendrite and these conductances are capable of supporting dendritic spike initiation, the resulting depolarization is less prolonged than in layer 5 pyramidal neurons.
21917809	348	We found a high divergence from positive interneurons outputs, which goes hand in hand with the convergence of many positive interneurons onto one PC we observed in our highly dense maps.

22114282	34	Thus, it remains difficult to infer whether and up to which degree monocular deprivation synaptic effects are layer and celltype specific along vertical V1 microcircuits.
22514308	34	Importantly, the up-state represents self-sustained engagement of the entire local network in recurrent loops, including inhibitory neurons.
15987765	119	Characteristic features of the axonal arbor were used to identify the morphological types of reconstructed interneurons as previously described (Lund and Lewis 1993).
15737062	344	To generate each random connection matrix in each of the B = 1,000 sets of matrices, we randomly picked four neurons from this 90 × 90 random connection matrix to form a 4 × 4 random connection matrix.
8459275	260	Axons of these nonpyramidal cells are mainly distributed in layers above the layer containing the somata.
22593736	93	Hence the regularity of spiking by L2/3 pyramidal neurons decreased with decreasing temperature.
19805321	163	Conversely, connections between neurons that have smaller than the critical number of synapses may not be strong enough to propagate neural activity effectively and are eliminated.
10195309	69	Furthermore, retrogradely filled neurons with a Golgi-like appearance were labeled abundantly (e.g., Figs.

21451062	562	Conditional bursting enhances resonant firing in neocortical layer 2–3 pyramidal neurons.

17717695	275	Cortico-thalamic axonal projections originate also from neurons in layer 5 (in particular layer 5B; Bourassa et al. 1995) but while L5B pyramidal cells receive synaptic input from ventral posteromedial nucleus their thalamic target region is the dorsal part of the posterior group, where they form clusters of giant terminal boutons, which may be involved in enhancing spatiotemporal discrimination (Hoogland et al. 1991; Veinante et al. 2000; Wright et al. 2000).

22593736	316	Dendritic mechanisms underlying the coupling of the dendritic with the axonal action potential initiation zone of adult rat layer 5 pyramidal neurons.
22798946	329	For example, Brown and Hestrin (Brown and Hestrin, 2009b) were able to demonstrate that in visual cortex the frequency of monosynaptic connections among corticostriatal layer 5 pyramidal cells is with 18% significantly higher than among corticocortical or corticotectal pyramids (for which the authors report values of 5 and 7%, respectively).
18466749	276	Application of the Kv1-specific blocker dendrotoxin-I or the Kv1.1 subunit-specific blocker dendrotoxin-K eliminated the characteristic delay to first spikes seen with near-threshold current injections, converting the discharge pattern from that of a dFS to a pattern of continuous fast-spiking cell.
15525762	247	We defined firing cacy may have significant functional consequences in the cerebral correlation as the fraction of spikes in one cell that occurred cortex, and it is therefore important to identify and study the cells within a window of 5 msec from a spike in the second cell, relative containing cannabinoid receptor-1 receptors.
22798946	187	The dashed red arrow in layer 5 marks a likely but not yet verified synaptic connection onto a corticocallosal layer 5 pyramidal cell.
22114282	180	The examples of subthreshold responses of Figure 3 show that 5TPs and 2/3Ps are similarly binocular in terms of synaptic inputs compared with the remaining cell types.
17122323	319	This cell was representative of 55% of non-fast-spiking cells tested in not showing any response to focal acetylcholine application.
12746859	42	We then reconstructed 158 cells to obtain their three-dimensional structure and created a list of variables that reflect their somatic and dendritic morphologies.
22114282	394	In both V1 (Schwark et al., 1986) and somatosensory cortex (Huang et al., 1998), action potential activity responses of the majority of layer 5 neurons are preserved during selective layer 2/3 inactivation.
14645486	90	The numerical density of calretinin and somatostatin neurons was determined using the optical disector method (West et al., 1991) as described previously (Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1997).
15539396	308	Two classes of K+ conductances were kinetically separated in nucleated patches from such neurones: slow inactivating (Ks) and fast inactivating (Kf).
20927409	30	Here we show that in fast-spiking interneurons, high-frequency trains of action potentials can generate a delayed and prolonged GABAergic self-inhibition due to sustained asynchronous release at fast-spiking-cell autapses.
17122323	260	C: pressure application of drug-free saline alone [artificial cerebrospinal fluid] generates hyperpolarizing responses selectively in fast-spiking neurons.
10884314	260	This appears to be unlikely for star pyramidal cells with a more radially symmetric dendritic field.
19805321	434	Second, we calculated the numbers of potential synapses for all of the selected neuron pairs leading to 10,000 bootstrap sets of potential synapse numbers.
2332787	121	The pattern of branching of the apical dendritic arbor was variable between cells, and some of this variation was related to the depth of the soma within the cortex (Fig. 1).
22114282	320	In addition, slice works indicate that visual deprivation differentially affects the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons present in different layers in rat V1 (Maffei et al., 2006; Maffei and Turrigiano, 2008; Nataraj et al., 2010).
19474331	330	Conversely, the high input resistance and long integration window of immature fast-spiking cells may permit them to fire in response to the sparser and weaker synaptic inputs present as they begin to integrate into spontaneously active developing cortical circuits.

19805321	137	It is important to mention that, because our analysis is based on very local laminar circuits (lateral separation between neurons is less than 50 m), it is not clear if the mechanism of cooperative synapse formation can be generalized to cortical circuits of a longer-range.
10884314	131	Multiple biocytin labeling of individual neurons in combination with cytochrome oxidase staining (n = 15 neurons) revealed that almost the entire dendritic and axonal domain of excitatory spiny neurons in layer 4 was confined to a single cortical column.
9236245	16	Data obtained from measurements in the rat brain show that lamina VI is one of the layers with highest cell density (Miller and Potempa, 1990).

16093380	228	In a sample of low-threshold spiking neurons aged P14 –P21, pairs with intersomatic distances of 200 m or more were never coupled (Amitai et al., 2002).
16467534	117	The rationale was that if AP initiation occurs axonal branch points in a subset of neurons (n 6) where AP in the proximal region of the axon, as the Voltage-sensitive dye experiments sugpropagation was tracked over 200 m of the axon (Fig. 2 B, gray gest, then reducing sodium current in this region would be exarrows).

20550566	47	However, in the mouse, little is currently known about the differential sensory information signalled by ventroposterior medial and posterior medial neurons, and further experimental work focusing on these issues will be of great importance.
22171028	326	Although strong L4-to-L6 connections were found in a few cases in photostimulation and multiple whole-cell recording studies (Zarrinpar and Callaway, 2006; Lefort et al., 2009; Hooks et al., 2011), these previous studies generally showed infrequency of L4-to-L6 excitatory connections (Briggs and Callaway, 2001; Zarrinpar and Callaway, 2006; Lefort et al., 2009; Llano and Sherman, 2009; Lam and Sherman, 2010; Hooks et al., 2011).
22002739	398	In the present study, about 40% subplate neurons in very young animals (P0–P2) are single spiking type; however, this percentage drops radically to about 15% in P3–5 animals and less than 5% in other age groups (Fig. 2c).
19805321	1	Clearly, only pairs of neurons with closely positioned axonal and dendritic branches can be synaptically coupled.
2332787	61	In this paper we describe the morphological features of pyramidal cells from layers 2/3 and 5 and use these features to establish cell classes.
17898147	201	In the majority of corticotrigeminal (19 of 21) and corticothalamic (7 of 10) neurons, the apical dendrite bifurcated into two to four primary apical dendrites that each terminated in a dendritic tuft near the pia.
22171028	205	The apposed boutons of L4 and L6 neurons showed peak positions closer to their cell bodies and narrower half widths than those of the other neuron groups.
15456817	196	Although chandelier cells are located primarily in layer 2/3 (Fairen and Valverde, 1980; Somogyi et al., 1982), where they form 3.4% of the GABAergic neurons (see Materials and Methods), Martinotti cells and neurogliaform cells are located principally outside layer 2/3 (Peters and Regidor, 1981; Wahle, 1993).

15525762	218	Altogether, these results suggest that, under these conditions, transmission of spikelets underlies the coordinated firing activity of cannabinoid receptor-1-expressing irregular-spiking cells.
16369481	232	The resulting cell suspension was diluted 200 with artificial cerebrospinal fluid and poured over a 100 mm Petri dish with Sylgard (Dow Corning) substratum.

11731554	51	Our results indicate that minimal stimulation of the callosum can evoke an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor–mediated monosynaptic EPSC in layer V pyramidal neurons in addition to the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) component, reported in previous studies (Kawaguchi 1992; Vogt and Gorman 1982).
10884314	281	No distinction was made between spiny stellate and star pyramidal neurons because they have similar axonal projection patterns.

15456817	159	However, a recent in vitro study in cat area 17 showed that even double bouquet cells tend to form most synapses in the same layer as their soma (Tama ́ s et al., 1997).
15987765	278	The other interneuron also produced a burst of spikes, but on a less prominent ramp of depolarization (Fig. 12D).

12037194	306	Figure 7H shows responses for the same subsets of neurons stimulated as before but at 100 Hz.
17898147	42	It is also unclear whether subtypes defined by morphological or physiological properties correlate to subpopulations of cortical neurons with the same set of axonal projections.
8459275	46	The somal size of the two classes of nonpyramidal cells was similar.
15182718	259	Third, we used in vivo whole-cell measurements to study the early development of receptive fields (Figures 8 and 9).

15456817	85	We assume that the chandelier cells and their axons are located primarily in layers 2/3 (Fairen and Valverde, 1980; Somogyi et al., 1982), and we ignore synapses formed in the remaining layers.
16369481	196	The greater similarity of expression in interneurons from the two regions may reflect the fact that interneurons migrate tangentially across cortical regions during development, whereas pyramidal neurons migrate vertically within a region37.

22114282	122	Ocular dominance was quantified by computing an ocular dominance index for each recorded neuron defined as (C I)/(C I), where C and I are the peak responses to stimulation through the contralateral and ipsilateral eyes, respectively.
22798946	511	In recent years (see above) it has become increasingly more evident that there is a large degree of diversity in excitatory neurons of the neocortex (in addition to the well-known diversity of inhibitory interneurons, see e.g., Ascoli et al., 2008) and that these different types of excitatory neurons have very distinct properties and functional roles in the cortical microcircuitry.
21451062	169	Peak current (and current density: current/whole cell capacitance) increased significantly with age (Fig. 2, A and C).
18971461	281	In the somatosensory cortex, L5 pyramidal cells receive common inputs from L2/3 pyramidal cells with higher probability than the assumed random cases when L5 pyramidal cells have connections with each other (Kampa et al., 2006).
16467534	145	Focal application of the sodium channel antagonist To determine how the site of AP initiation in the proximal axon tetrodotoxin (10 M; 5 ms) to the proximal axon ( 20 m from the axon site relates to axon myelination, we made sequential whole-cell hillock) also led to a significant increase in AP threshold (by recordings from oligodendrocytes and layer 5 pyramidal neurons 14.6 4.5 mV) and rise time (by 137 45 s) and a decrease (by using patch pipettes filled with different fluorescent dyes (Alexa 28.2 6.0 mV) in AP amplitude (n 6; p 0.05) (Fig. 3D).
16467534	282	Finally, it is important to note that the axon initial segment receives direct inhibitory synaptic input from GABAergic interneurons (DeFelipe et al., 1985; Buhl et al., 1994).
22514308	527	The details of laminar connectivity are based on recordings from pairs of neurons (Feldmeyer et al., 2002; Thomson et al., 2002) and from circuit mapping based on glutamate uncaging (Shepherd et al., 2005; Schubert et al., 2007).
21917809	138	To explore whether interneurons that did not generate a response in the PC could be potentially also connected to it, we also patched eight photostimulated positive interneurons for which no response was observed (negatives).

12746859	17	The exact catalog of neocortical cell types and the description of their connections appear essential for the elucidation of their functions.
8574660	176	Although evident in all in bursting neurons, it was by no means specific for them since it could also be demonstrated in some of the regular spiking neurons adapting neurons (Fig. 6B3,4) and was often more evident when the membrane was artificially slightly hyperpolarized.

15539396	2	In this study we show that in bitufted interneurones from layer 2/3 of the somatosensory cortex, the height and width of APs recorded at the soma are sensitive to changes in the resting membrane potential, suggesting subthreshold activity of voltage-gated conductances.

17122323	225	However, bath-applied atropine (1 M) failed to block or significantly reduce hyperpolarizing responses in six of six neurons tested, suggesting they did not result from mAChR activation (Fig. 7B and Table 3; responses were 1.8 0.9 mV in baseline conditions and 1.8 1.1 mV after application of atropine).

7904301	387	Thus, the monosynaptic input probably arises from layer V cells at the stimulation site.
17898147	265	Likewise, almost all of the membrane and firing properties of corticotrigeminal neurons recorded in picrotoxin were not significantly different from those recorded in bicuculline.
12746859	343	We could distinguish two subgroups: one of “diffuse” dendritic arbors (subgroup 3A) and one of “narrow” pyramidal neurons (subgroup 3B).

14673000	37	Cells that showed large changes in series resistance were discarded for data analysis purposes.
19295167	704	Furthermore, these neurons exhibit pharmacological profiles distinct from other Neuropeptide Y-expressing interneurons but, interestingly, similar to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons because they are responsive to nicotinic (Porter et al., 1999; Christophe et al., 2002; Gulledge et al., 2007), -opioid (Fe ́re ́zou et al., 2007), and presumably 5-HT3 agonists (Zhou and Hablitz, 1999; Fe ́re ́zou et al., 2002).

17717695	145	In contrast to ventral posteromedial nucleus neurons, posterior medial nucleus projection neurons send axons mainly to layers 5A and 1 as well as to the so-called septa between the barrels in layer 4 (Chmielowska et al. 1989; Koralek et al. 1988; Lu and Lin 1993).
15182718	228	Individual cells, open circles; average, black circles.
19805321	66	To reconcile the experimental observations of highly tuned connectivity between synaptically coupled neurons with broadly distributed potential synapse numbers, we next explored the possibility of cooperative (not independent) synapse formation.
7904301	393	Pyramidal cells in layer V provide monosynaptic inputs to cells in all layers of a distal column by synapsing on two dendritic fields: in layer II/III and in middle layer V.
10884314	259	Because the axonal and the dendritic field span of a spiny stellate cell show a strong overlap and cover one-third to two-thirds of a barrel (;200 – 400 μm in diameter), the strong asymmetry of the dendritic field could result in segregation of the inputs within an individual barrel.
12746859	29	In some cases, specific types of neurons have been described in combination with the physiological and chemical properties of these cells, but there has been no objective classification of cortical neurons based on morphologic criteria that most investigators would agree upon.
17317752	281	The L5 slender-tufted cells exhibited their peak response at longer latencies, but also the receptive field was collapsed after another 50 ms.

9592109	229	Finally, the present model raises questions, but provides no answers, regarding the intriguing relation between oriented receptive field subunits that could be computed within the postsynaptic dendritic milieu of an individual LGN-recipient complex cell and those computed by a presynaptic population of simple cells, where in principle both could mix within the dendrites of a single complex cell.
17267749	357	However, one must take into account the fact that a large number of the excitatory synaptic inputs to these layer 2/3 neurons (85–90%) are on the basal and apical oblique dendrites (Larkman 1991), which were not investigated by Froemke et al. Modeling studies indicate that the range of rise times for excitatory postsynaptic potentials we recorded are within those predicted for basal and apical oblique inputs (Trevelyan and Jack 2002; Trevelyan, unpublished observations).
22114282	300	Thus, the binocular index of action potential activity responses is 1 for monocular cells and becomes higher the more binocular neurons are.

19641119	14	Interneurons are heterogeneous in their postsynaptic targets, molecular expression, and temporal activity (Freund and Buzsaki, 1996; Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997; Kisva ́ rday et al., 1997; Swadlow et al., 1998; Cauli et al., 2000; Gupta et al., 2000; Markram et al., 2004; Tamas et al., 2004; Bacci et al., 2005; Fo ̈ldy et al., 2005; Krimer et al., 2005; Dumitriu et al., 2007; Kapfer et al., 2007; Ali and Thomson, 2008; Ascoli et al., 2008; Galarreta et al., 2008; Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008; Helmstaedter et al., 2009).
14645486	295	We have found that maximally 2% of feedforward pathways and feedback inputs go to somatostatin neurons in layer 2/3.
19805321	161	Since the number of synapses between neurons is positively correlated with the connection strength (2, 21–23), this mechanism may be similar to those of long-term potentiation and depression (37–41).

8574660	273	Also ineffective in preventing bursting discharges were unselective procedures affecting Ca 2+ currents (Ca2+-free and Mn 2+ or Co 2+ substituted medium) which actually enhanced bursting activity although they were never effective in transforming regular spiking neurons into in bursting neurons.
21917809	67	The neurons were viewed with a 100 oil objective on an Olympus IX71 inverted light microscope or an Olympus BX51 upright light microscope.
17317752	301	We therefore estimated the average output of every cell by summing the number of APs per stimulus for the principal whisker and all first order SuWs.
17122323	372	In addition, two biocytin-labeled late-spiking cells in layer 2/3 were found to have nicotinic responsiveness but were negative for both vasoactive intestinal peptide and cholecystokinin (Fig. 11C).
16457955	9	In this study, we analyzed the the density, number and distribution of spines along the density of dendritic spines in the motor, somatosensory and dendrites of pyramidal neurons, particularly in the neocorvisuo-temporal regions of the mouse cerebral cortex.

11731554	221	To test this hypothesis, spontaneously occurring EPSCs recorded from neurons under identical conditions as those during intracortical or callosal stimulation were analyzed and compared at the holding potentials of 640 mV (Fig. 6, A1 and A2).
9007187	400	A large number of strongly diaphorase-reactive neurones throughout areas 25, 32 and 24b gave rise to clearly defined axon-like processes (Figs.
17898147	55	Corticotectal and -pontine cells are thick tufted, intrinsically bursting cells found in lower layer V, whereas callosal neurons have smaller somata and are thin tufted, regular-spiking cells found in upper layer V.
22798946	251	Studies using photo-release of caged glutamate to stimulate synaptic connections onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (Shepherd et al., 2005; Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005; Schubert et al., 2006) revealed that these neurons show differential excitation pattern depending on their location in relation to the barrel field.
21368112	165	Our data suggest that thick-tufted neurons may contribute significantly less to signaling via intracortical pathways (Fig. 7B) than slender-tufted neurons.

15456817	247	Unassigned symmetric synapses are likely to be contributed by the various smooth neurons.
10884314	290	Inf ragranular layers In analogy to the visual cortex, spiny layer 4 neurons may also establish synaptic contacts with layer 6 pyramidal neurons and in turn may receive synapses from these neurons (Gilbert and Wiesel, 1979; Martin and Whitteridge, 1984; McGuire et al., 1984; Benshalom and White, 1986; Ahmed et al., 1994; Stratford et al., 1996; Tarczy-Hornoch et al., 1999).
21118703	31	As a natural extension of hand drawn camera lucida representations of neuron shape, digital reconstructions allow for an almost unlimited variety of quantitative morphometrics (Vallotton et al., 2007; Scorcioni et al., 2008), as well as providing the basis for computational models of morphology (e.g. Hillman, 1979; Burke et al., 1992; also reviewed by Donohue and Ascoli, 2005) and electrophysiology (Lazarewicz et al., 2002; Migliore et al., 2003; Davison et al., 2004).
21286222	174	Here we show that the spiking patterns of layer 5 pyramidal neurons are even more flexible than previously thought: even in the absence of synaptic activity pyramidal neurons can adopt different spiking patterns in response to the same stimulus.
22427971	2	For these neurons, therefore, both the location and timing of synaptic inputs are critical.
9570781	245	Furthermore, the extent of sag and the increase in input resistance in CsCl were similar during whole-cell and perforated-patch recording, suggesting that whole-cell recording also has little effect on C s-sensitive conductances.
17317752	157	Layer 4 cells showed a threefold higher evoked action potential response (0.41 ± 0.41 APs per stimulus).
18971461	261	Although frequency characteristics of synaptic transmission from pyramidal cell to inhibitory interneurons depend on the presynaptic pyramidal subtypes (Angulo et al., 2003), the frequency characteristics of connections between pyramidal cells may appear to be independent of subtype, and may rather be related to the plastic change of unitary connections.

22114282	164	Visually unresponsive 6Ps were clustered within the deeper subdivision of layer 6 (Fig. 2 B; t test, p 0.05): they were either “tall” layer 6 pyramidal neurons (6Ps) of lower layer 6A or deep layer 6B neurons (Briggs, 2010) (Fig. 1).
15987765	218	Of the 159 morphologically identified neurons, only 111 were included in the dendrogram because the cluster analysis excluded the remaining 48 neurons as a result of at least one missing variable.
7904301	390	The longer duration of sink at certain depths may suggest the presence of disynaptic activity generated via recurrent collaterals of layer II-III cells synapsing on dendrites of cells having somata in either superficial or deep layers.
9570781	67	Comparison of somatic and apical dendritic diameters from infrared differential interference contrast images of the living cell with that of the cell after fixation and staining allowed us to directly determine the extent of tissue shrinkage, which was found to be minimal.
19641119	342	In conclusion, we have demonstrated that two identified types of GABAergic prefrontal interneuron provide differential spatiotemporal input to pyramidal cells depending on the ongoing brain states as defined by hippocampal theta or local spindle oscillations.
15772358	5	This difference in selectivity was attributable to the rectification imposed by the spike threshold on the input– output function of cells.
17698015	292	Furthermore, the widespread expression of Kv1 channels in other excitatory (Guan et al., 2006) and inhibitory neurons in the neocortex (Wang et al., 2004), along with the prevalence of local connections formed by proximal presynaptic terminals in cortical areas (Binzegger et al., 2004), makes it likely that the findings described here will also apply to other intracortical connections.
12900914	293	In adult rats, these neurons receive 10 –12% of feedforward connections and feedback connections inputs (Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1999).
19295167	435	At high stimulation intensities, glutamatergic neurons also exhibited a marked spike amplitude accommodation, a pronounced early frequency adaptation (Fig. 5 A, C; Table 6), and a low maximal steady-state frequency (Table 6), which were also distinctive features.
12900914	295	In mouse, however, the proportions of feedforward connections and feedback connections inputs to parvalbumin neurons are smaller (7–10%), which suggests that the ratio of interareal inputs to GABAergic and non-GABAergic cells is different.
19641119	6	We show that pyramidal cells in the ventral hippocampus also fire around the peak of dorsal CA1 theta cycles, in contrast to previously reported dorsal hippocampal pyramidal cells.

15182718	231	Five out of six neurons recovered histologically were located in the barrel corresponding to the whisker producing the largest response.
19641119	32	However, in contrast to the growing knowledge of the contribution of pyramidal cells, little is known about the activity of cortical interneurons.
12759179	61	In no case could we evoke a monosynaptic response further than 2 mm from a cell.
20927409	58	Here we report that high-frequency firing in fast-spiking interneurons results in a massive (.10-fold), delayed, and prolonged (for seconds) increase in inhibitory events, occurring at both autaptic (fast-spiking–fast-spiking) and synaptic (fast-spiking–P) sites.
18466749	23	AP threshold is a basic biophysical property of all spiking neurons.
11826166	104	allowed their identification as excitatory neurones; this was subsequently confirmed by histological processing.
15987765	209	In general the axons of arbor cells were confined within the layer containing its soma (layer 2 or 3) and did not spread into layer 1.
2332787	14	These cells were termed slender layer 5 cells and were found throughout the layer.
22171028	313	Strong local excitatory inputs to L6 corticothalamic projection neurons from their own layer were found in previous studies using laser-scanning photostimulation by glutamate uncaging (Zarrinpar and Callaway, 2006; Llano and Sherman, 2009; Lam and Sherman, 2010; Hooks et al., 2011).
22002739	229	This paired-pulse response was comparable to the findings of subplate neurons in the visual cortex of P10–20 rats (Torres-Reveron and Friedlander 2007).
22798946	160	Note that layer 4 spiny neurons provide synaptic output to virtually all L5A and L5B pyramidal neurons in a barrel column.
15525762	121	Furthermore, we recorded from layer II/III Fast-spiking cells (n 5), known to contain parvalbumin, and found that none of the tested cells were immunopositive for cannabinoid receptor-1 receptors (Fig. 3E–H ).
10884314	270	Supragranular layers Spiny layer 4 neurons subsequently relay excitation to layer 2/3 but because of the largely columnar organization of the axons of these neurons it remains restricted to neurons within the same cortical column (Feldmeyer et al., 1999a,b).
17898147	149	Instead, these projections may terminate on other known caudal targets of barrel cortex neurons including the spinal cord and medullary reticular formation (Landry et al. 1984; Wise and Jones 1977a).

18216227	238	Thus in this study, almost all excitatory postsynaptic currents that were evoked by two-photon macro photolysis of caged glutamate” originated from medium-sized pyramidal neurons in layers 2/3 and 4 and we estimated the number of presynaptic pyramidal neurons only in layer 2/3.
12746859	275	The tall narrow-tufted pyramids of subgroup 1B could be further subdivided into two subgroups: one with elongated cell bodies (1B1; Fig.
15987765	331	Arbor and vertically oriented cells demonstrated more diverse structure–functional correspondence, perhaps as a result of significant molecular diversity among the interneurons of similar morphological types (Cauli et al. 1997; Markram et al. 2004; Pawelzik et al.

22798946	209	Barrel-related pyramidal neurons in lower layer 2/3 (often referred to as layer 3) receive strong input from layer 4 while those in upper layer 2/3 (i.e., layer 2) Septum-related layer 2 and layer 3 pyramids, are only weakly innervated by barrel- and septum-related layer 4 neurons (Bureau et al., 2006).
14602839	109	The resting membrane potential (V ) was measured immediately after achieving whole cell r configuration.
16369481	68	We found that the `present' count increased with the number of cells, from 1 (27% present, n = 2) to 5 (31% present, n = 2) to 30 or more (46% present, n = 42).
17122323	326	This difference was further reflected in the subthreshold membrane properties of these neurons, with nAChR-responding neurons having a significantly larger R N than other non-fast-spiking cells (310 109 vs. 249 81 M , respectively; n 60, P 0.05).

12456830	265	Given the evidence from in vitro and in vivo whole-cell recordings, it is conceivable that tetrodotoxin does not show a significant reduction of mEPSC frequency.
15772358	263	However, the selectivity of neurons recorded with pipettes containing N-ethyl bromide quaternary salt (QX-314), which blocks several voltage-gated currents including potassium and calcium (Connors and Prince, 1982; Mulle et al., 1985), was comparable with that measured in control conditions (data not shown).
12759179	114	Every layer 5 neuron tested responded to electrical stimuli delivered in supragranular, granular and infragranular layers.
18466749	63	This is in contrast to pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 barrel cortex, which had interspike interval interspike/interspike values of 0.35 ± 0.08 (n = 4; p < 0.01 versus fast-spiking cells) and interspike interval interspike/ ISIn of 0.31 ± 0.08 (n = 4; p < 0.01 versus fast-spiking cells) (Figure 1F).

17122323	363	Neurons not responsive to focal acetylcholine fell into two groups, parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking neurons (n 6) and somatostatin-positive non-fast-spiking neurons (n 5; data not shown).
7904301	398	It is possible that vertically oriented ascending axon collaterals of layer V cells synapse with inhibitory neurons within a single column, and therefore these interactions cannot be revealed in the CSDs.
9007187	597	Parvalbumin-immunoreactive puncta also surround another unlabelled neurone (n) and surround an unlabelled descending process that arises from the cell body.
17334362	93	As in the example, FS cells had the largest amplitudes in17 of 20 pairs (Fig. 3c–f), resulting in a 4.3-fold greater average (Table 1).
22114282	377	This, together with the observed reduction of spontaneous firing, suggests that monocular deprivation produces a cell-type-specific decrease of excitability of 5TPs, a result recently confirmed in vitro (Nataraj et al., 2010).

11826166	320	Note the typical asymmetric dendritic configuration of the spiny stellate neurone that is confined to layer 4 whereas the pyramidal cell shows a symmetric basal dendritic field and an apical dendrite with an extensive terminal tuft.

12695107	92	Generally, up to 15 cells can be injected per slice, with injections sufficiently far apart to avoid overlapping of the dendritic trees.
17267749	321	In a previous report where both long-term potentiation and long-term depression were observed in response to the same induction protocol (in layer 2/3 rat visual cortex), initial paired-pulse ratio, a measure of presynaptic strength, was shown to predict the direction of the plasticity in individual cells (Volgushev et al. 1997, 2000), whereas changes in paired-pulse ratio after pairing were negatively correlated with initial paired-pulse ratio values.

16093380	8	The developmental transformation of low-threshold spiking interneurons into a synchronous, oscillatory network overlaps with the onset of active somatosensory exploration, suggesting a potential role for this synchronizing system in sensory processing.
18466749	138	Moreover, dendrotoxin-I had no effect on the time from onset of current injection to the peak of the first AP elicited at ITH in pyramidal cells (control, 188.3 ± 32.3 ms; dendrotoxin-I, 185 ± 35.9 ms; n = 5; p = 0.72) (Figure S6A).
15737062	228	For example, in the feedforward projection from granule to Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, the distribution was fitted by a truncated Gaussian distribution, argued to be optimal for information storage [40].
20927409	35	Since each fast-spiking cell contacts many P neurons, asynchronous release from a single interneuron may desynchronize a large portion of the local network and disrupt cortical information processing.
18971461	244	In a way similar to ours, several studies have identified three or more groups of L5 pyramidal cells by in vitro or in vivo recordings from various cortical areas and species (Connors et al., 1982; Nun~ ez et al., 1993; Schwindt et al., 1997; De ́ gene` tais et al., 2002; Schubert et al., 2006; Chang and Luebke, 2007).
9236245	112	Corticothalamic cells that project to both ventral posteromedial nucleus and posterior group are grouped into the lower half of lamina V Ia.
19295167	24	Neuropeptide Y neurons are mainly GABAergic (Hendry et al., 1984a; Demeulemeester et al., 1988; Aoki and Pickel, 1989; Kubota et al., 1994).
22427971	121	L6 and L2/3 pyramidal neurons exhibited similar coincidence detection windows to each other but were narrower than in L5 cells implying these cells require more precise synaptic inputs for this effect.
14673000	233	Thus, we find no evidence in favor of the notion that dopamine modulates active conductances in the apical dendrites of prefrontal pyramidal neurons.
22798946	456	Conversely, ipsilateral motor-to-somatosensory connections innervate layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons via axon collaterals that ramify in both layer 5 and 6 as well as layer 1 (Cauller et al., 1998; Veinante and Deschênes, 2003; Petreanu et al., 2009; Matyas et al., 2010; Mao et al., 2011).
17122323	60	On the contrary, they showed that focal acetylcholine application (5 mM) generates muscarinic inhibition of fast-spiking interneurons, while exciting some non-fast-spiking interneurons via nicotinic receptor (nAChR) activation.
9880578	163	A,a, Average miniature I PSC s recorded in a single cell in control conditions and during the application of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 μM zolpidem, from lef t to right.

22593736	120	Hence layer 2/3, layer 5, and layer 6 pyramidal neurons all display more variable inter-spike intervals at 24–26◦C than at physiological temperatures, but with most layer 2/3 and layer 6 neurons adopting adapting spiking patterns at colder temperatures, rather than the bursting patterns observed in layer 5.
21118703	205	B) Statistics from reconstructed neurons can be used to improve algorithms in an iterative fashion.

9457640	38	location of action potential initiation in neocortical pyramidal neurons based on either single site dendritic recordings Layer 5 pyramidal neurons were identified using infrared illumination combined with differential interference contrast optics (Amitai, Friedman, Connors & Gutnick, 1993) or dual and video microscopy, and patch-pipette recordings (cell-attached simultaneous somatic and dendritic or somatic and axonal voltage clamp or whole-cell current clamp; seal resistances > 1 GQ) recordings (Stuart & Sakmann, 1994).
21917809	29	niques have been developed to reveal synaptically connected neurons, including paired whole-cell recordings (Thomson and Lamy, 2007), serial EM reconstructions (Denk and Horstmann, 2004; Bock et al., 2011), viral tracing (Wickersham et al., 2007), calcium imaging probing (Peterlin et al., 2000), reverse correlation imaging (Aaron and Yuste, 2006), and photostimulation with caged glutamate (Callaway and Katz, 1993).
17698015	68	Similar results were obtained when dendrotoxin-I was included in the pipette solution during cell-attached recordings.
15525762	317	However, more experiments are necessary to examine the interaction among cannabinoid receptor-1-expressing irregular-spiking cells and how this network orchestrate the activity of other neocortical populations.

12746859	315	Indeed, the average total tile circularity index of neurons in 2B was close to that of the tall pyramidal neurons of group 1.

16701210	20	GABAB can also lead to more complex effects on postsynaptic excitability by inhibiting Ca2+ conductances (Bettler et al., 2004; Campbell et al., 1993; Mintz and Bean, 1993; Scholz and Miller, 1991); for example, it has been shown that GABAB receptors can inhibit dendritic Ca2+ currents in isolated dendritic segments of hippocampal neurons (Kavalali et al., 1997).
17122323	360	Previous data from immunohistochemical (Kawaguchi 1997; Kawaguchi and Kondo 2002) and single-cell PCR (Porter et al. 1999) studies suggest that cholinergic responsiveness correlates with the expression patterns for vasoactive intestinal peptide, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, and parvalbumin.

16267239	169	In these neurons, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation produced an increase in membrane conductance of 31 5% during the peak of the hyperpolarizing response (n 12; p 0.05).
17317752	83	The (non-parametric) Mann–Whitney U test was used for comparison of correlation coefficient between and across cell types (Fig. 5D inset).
16369481	41	This definition of the cell type was intrinsically hierarchical: each cell type belonged to a larger, functionally defined cell type (for example, interneurons and pyramidal neurons) and may have also comprised further recognizable subtypes.
17334362	260	If so, then FS cells, which have broad suprathreshold receptive fields4,5, would be predicted to have robust separation between Ge and Gi for equally broad ranges of sensory stimuli.
16093380	15	First, low-threshold spiking cells form frequent inhibitory connections onto local excitatory cells as well as onto the fast-spiking type of inhibitory interneurons (Gibson et al., 1999; Beierlein et al., 2003).
17317752	274	Other cell types had lower values, indicating higher cell-to-cell variability.
17317752	519	Evidence for synchronous activation of neurons located in different layers of primary somatosensory cortex.
8459275	466	The differential mode of spikefiring among nonpyramidal cells with different innervation selectivity by layer or column should therefore play an important role in neocortical function.
18466749	415	Synaptic basis for intense thalamocortical activation of feedforward inhibitory cells in neocortex.
15539396	462	Temporal integration by a slowly inactivating K+ current in hippocampal neurons.
21451062	300	Thus in most cells the rising phase of the ScTx-sensitive outward current (tested in the presence of dendrotoxin, margatoxin, and 100 M CdCl ) was steeper than expected for 2 Kv2-mediated current alone (e.g., Fig.
16467534	183	Because it is known that branch points commonly arise from nodes of Ranvier (Sloper and Powell, 1979; Fraher and Kaar, 1984), we searched for the first axonal collateral process of layer 5 pyramidal neuron axons after filling neurons with a fluorescent dye (Alexa 568) using confocal microscopy (Fig. 6 A).
19474331	165	Consistent with this loss of adaptation, our microarray results revealed a 15-fold downregulation of the small conductance Ca 2 -activated K channel Kcnn2, which contributes to the medium component of the afterhyperpolarization after an action potential in multiple cell types (Bond et al., 2004; Kong et al., 2008; Liu and Herbison, 2008).
22114282	178	This index varies from 1 to 1 depending on whether cells are dominated by the ipsilateral or contralateral eye, respectively, whereas the ocular dominance index is 0 for perfectly binocular neurons.
17317752	209	It is unlikely that initial activity in L5 thick-tufted cells and L6 depend on intracortical spread of activity originating from layer 4.
15987765	275	One of the interneurons produced a burst of spikes on a prominent depolarization ramp (Fig. 12C).
15182718	60	(2) At PND 12, layer 2/3 pyramidal cells have largely mature dendritic morphology (Maravall et al., 2004a) but are only weakly driven by sensory stimulation (Stern et al., 2001).
17122323	375	This difference in response duration was not dependent on the duration of acetylcholine application (mean puff duration was 30 16 ms in vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive cells and 46 31 ms in vasoactive intestinal peptide-negative neurons), suggesting that it may reflect cell-type-specific differences in nAChR expression.
10884314	105	The outline of neurons was then drawn with the aid of a camera lucida attached to an Olympus BX50 microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) at a final magnification of 720×.
22171028	323	L6 corticothalamic projection neurons have might be well represented by the strong, fo- dense recurrent connections of a subcolumnar size within themselves (green), whereas L6 corticocortical neurons provide corticothalamic projection neurons cused L4-to-CTN connection revealed in with a considerable amount of horizontal connection beyond the barrel column (black).
15912501	439	Cat visual corticopontine cells project to the superior colliculus.
15987765	146	Once threshold was reached, fast-spiking cells generated trains of spikes with high frequencies and small, if any, frequency adaptation.
9007187	406	Where axon-like processes could be traced, fine collaterals were found to be emitted close to the cell body and give rise to numerous axonal swellings (Fig. 6C).
15737062	163	Correlation of Connection Strengths in Two-Neuron Patterns Next, we analyzed the correlations between the strengths of the synaptic connections in two-neuron patterns.
22171028	206	Differences in the peak distance and half width between L4 neuron group and L2/3, L5b, or L6 group, or those between L6 group and L2/3 or L6 group showed statistical significance (Fig. 6 D, E).
17478724	84	If such excitatory axo-axonic synapses are present, the frequency of miniature IPSCs recorded from pyramidal cells in the presence of 1 mM tetrodotoxin, a sodium channel blocker, may be affected by glutamatergic agents.
15101088	32	Hundreds of completely reconstructed neurons have been made available in digital format (reviewed in Ascoli, 2002).
15456817	217	One study also revealed a layer 6 pyramidal cell with a dominant projection in layer 2/3 (Hirsch et al., 1998).
22593736	30	Layer 6 pyramidal neurons were likewise visually identified, 1300–1600 μm from the pial edge of the slice.
18971461	80	From firing frequencies (f) calculated from the first, second, seventh, and shortest interspike intervals [f1, f2, and f7 (Fig. 1C, inset) during the current pulse injection (amplitude, 500pA; duration, 1 s)] in individual cells, we obtained the burst (f1/f2), the adaptation index (f7/f2), and the maximum frequency.
15182718	101	This is reflected in an upward trend in the mean horizontal distance of input with development, and at PND 16, cells above septa received inputs from significantly more distant layer 4 presynaptic cells than did cells above barrels (Mann-Whitney, p 0.01; Figure 3D).
15182718	274	The timing of this differentiation of layer 2/3 cells into two distinct local-circuit phenotypes coincides with the closure of a critical period for their receptive field development (Stern et al., 2001).
22114282	197	The majority of neurons are dominated by contralateral inputs (postsynaptic potential-ODIs 0) and produces action potential activity outputs that are even more contralateral (points residing above the dashed line).
12695107	25	Obtaining accurate 3D morphological reconstructions of pyramidal neurons is therefore a crucial first step in evaluating the role of structure in normal and pathologic cognitive function.
19151697	4	Within the dendritic arborizations of L3 cells, individual inputs impinged onto distinct single domains.
18466749	76	We found that, among dFS cells in layer 2/3 barrel cortex, delayed firing existed within a range of 1.00 to 1.25 ± 0.13 times ITH (n = 23; data not shown); that is, the fast-spiking cell firing pattern converted from that of a dFS cell to that of a continuous fast-spiking cell cell at, on average, 1.25 times ITH.

20927409	343	CCK-positive cells typically display an adapting firing pattern; they cannot sustain high-frequency firing rates (.50 Hz; [39,68]) and can only be recruited transiently by repetitive stimulation [66].
21753015	28	Recently, differences have been reported in the connection probability between pyramidal cells projecting to specific subcortical targets, such as the tectum, striatum, or contralateral cortex (Brown and Hestrin, 2009).

11826166	595	Excitatory synaptic inputs to spiny stellate cells in cat visual cortex.
22798946	423	Connections with layer 4 were also observed for postsynaptic corticocortical L6A neurones (Qi and Feldmeyer, 2010).
20720120	430	Overall, the dedicated theta generation mechanisms and special loop connectivity (putative entorhinal cortex2–entorhinal cortex2; E2–entorhinal cortex3–entorhinal cortex2) lend support to the hypothesized mechanisms underlying grid pattern formation in entorhinal cortex2 cells (Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997; Fuhs and Touretzky, 2006; McNaughton et al., 2006; Moser and Moser, 2008).
12695107	50	Of particular note is the excellent reduction of blurring along the Z axis (XZ plane), permitting morphology of individual spines superimposed on previously oversaturated dendritic trunks to be resolved.
22798946	662	Intracortical circuits of pyramidal neurons reflect their long-range axonal targets.
7904301	350	In addition, layer V cells may suppress the excitatory input arriving from the upper layers by inhibiting one another ( Landry et al. 1984).
19914188	38	Figures 1A and 1B illustrate the tuning of five juxtacells with responses typical of their class (see also Figure S4).
16369481	177	The results revealed a high degree of heterogeneity of gene expression across cell types within a single region, comparable to or exceeding that previously observed across distinct tissues27,28 or brain regions29.
8574660	130	In the regular spiking neurons neuron (A 1), tetraethylammonium induced a slowing of theAP repolarizing phase (A 2) and the almost complete disappearance of spike frequency adaptation.
12759179	90	We found no correlation between a layer 5 neuron's firing pattern and its ability to respond to a distant laterally placed stimulus.
22798946	29	The density and distribution of excitatory neurons are clearly one of them and have been used already in early publications on the organization of the neocortex (Ramón y Cajal, 1904; Lorente de Nó, 1922).

17267749	38	Subsequently, the neuron could be identified as a pyramid by its asymmetric spikes with faster rise phases than decay phases, typical of pyramidal neurons in this layer (Mason et al. 1991; McCormick et al. 1985).

15456817	147	The axons of the remaining spiny cell types typically avoided innervating layer 4.
9592109	37	In a precursor to the present work, it was established in Mel (1992b, 1993) that a neocortical pyramidal cell driven by strong NMDA-type synaptic currents and/or containing dendritic Ca2+ or Na+ channels, can respond more strongly when synapses are activated in spatially clustered groups, in comparison with the same number of synapses activated diffusely about the dendritic arbor.
18466749	35	In many cases, we used transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein driven by the promoter of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (parvalbumin; a known marker of fast-spiking cells; Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997) for the efficient targeting of fast-spiking cells (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online).
16093380	14	The low-threshold spiking inhibitory interneurons of the neocortex have several characteristics that might allow them to serve as a general spike-synchronizing mechanism.
9880578	117	B, The average of miniature IPSCs with no overlap (taken for duration measurements) is shown for the same cell.
9236245	9	We conclude that (1) dendritic morphology and axonal arborizations of corticothalamic cells relate to the projection target; (2) many apparently diverse layer VI cells project to other cortical fields; and (3) lamina VI is a network for corticothalamic and corticocortical communication.

19914188	311	Information-Theoretic Analysis To estimate how well a neuron's firing rate could be predicted from the tone presented, we used a cross-validation approach, which provides a lowerbound estimate of the cells information content (Harris et al., 2003; Itskov et al., 2008; Kjaer et al., 1994).

8459275	266	Main axons of some fast-spiking cells (fast-spiking cells with local innervation; n = 10) branched soon after their origins and made a dense innervation field in proximity to the soma.
22002739	389	Second, the excitability of subplate neurons decreases with age.
9007187	623	The mean somatic profile diameter of calbindin D-28k+ neurones was 11.6 6 0.9 μm (mean 6 S.D.; Table 1), ranging in size from 5.6 μm to 22.3 μm (Table 1).
21118703	45	While both Amira and Neurolucida now contain automated reconstruction tools, to the best of our knowledge these tools were not used to create any of the cells in NeuroMorpho.org.
2332787	127	Eleven cells could be distinguished by having relatively thick apical trunks which gave rise to obvious terminal arbors in layer 1.
21368112	58	Third, two of five neurons displayed significant innervation of higherorder dysgranular cortices adjacent to the vibrissal area (Fig.

22427971	1	Pyramidal neurons, the most widespread excitatory neuron of the neocortex have multiple spike initiation zones, which interact via dendritic and somatic spikes actively propagating in all directions within the dendritic tree.
17334362	167	This discrepancy occurred mainly because the FS cell had a fivefold higher resting input 0.1 conductance than the RS cell (Fig. 1d and 0 0.1 1 10 0 35 70 Supplementary Fig.

21880904	3	While spine remodeling occurs in multiple cortical regions, it is not yet known whether interneuron dendrite remodeling is common across primary sensory and higher-level cortices.
22798946	216	In addition to pyramidal cells of layer 5A and 5B, layer 4 spiny neurons target also pyramidal cells in layer 6, although the observed connectivity ratio was very low (Lefort et al., 2009; Qi and Feldmeyer, 2010; Tanaka et al., 2011).

17698015	496	Properties of action potential initiation in neocortical pyramidal cells: evidence from whole cell axon recordings.
15525762	311	GABAergic interneurons exhibit very heterogeneous physiological properties, and both their intrinsic membrane properties as well as the specific characteristics of their synaptic connections (chemical and electrical) could affect the frequency of the synchronous oscillatory activity they promote (Traub et al., 1996; Wang and Buzsa ́ ki, 1996; Beierlein et al., 2000; Tama ́ s et al., 2000; Szabadics et al., 2001; Bartos et al., 2002; Blatow et al., 2003).
9007187	152	Cell nuclei were used to define "test" objects (Weibel, 1980; West, 1993).
17898147	274	In contrast, most corticothalamic (17 of 18) and all corticotrigeminal neurons produced prominent fast afterhyperpolarizations and DAPs that followed every spike.
17717695	17	These neurons were organized in 300–500 lm-sized blocks of neocortical tissue (latter coined cortical columns; reviewed by Mountcastle 1997; see Figs.

16793907	226	The large differences in the mean amplitude of unitary EPSPs between different layer 2/3 pyramidal cell pairs may therefore be determined to a significant degree by differences in the functional properties of the projection and the target neuron (Koester & Johnston, 2005), rather than by differences in their morphology, as has been suggested previously for connections between L5B pyramidal cells (Markram et al. 1997).

15539396	89	In subsequent experiments, synaptic properties of pyramid-to-interneurone connections were not tested and cells were selected based on their shape, firing pattern and K+ currents in nucleated patches.

21917809	361	In addition, Fast-spiking cells preferentially targeted pyramidal cells that provided reciprocal excitatory connections (Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005).

18971461	83	The burst index of spike frequency adaptation-d type cells was significantly higher value than those found in spike frequency adaptation and frequency adaptation type cells (Fig. 1C, left histogram) (1.59 0.46, 7.42 3.36, and 2.14 0.66, for spike frequency adaptation, spike frequency adaptation-d, and frequency adaptation type, respectively, n 150 for each subtype, p 0.01).
18216227	225	whereas the other showed a short onset latency (5.2 0.8 ms, n 11 sites for 2 cells) and a slow rise time (13.6 1.2 ms) (Fig. 4, C and D).
15182718	173	Since neurons in the developing cortex are rarely driven to threshold by sensory stimuli (Albus and Wolf, 1984; Armstrong-James, 1975; Fregnac and Imbert, 1978; Hubel and Wiesel, 1963), we used whole-cell voltage clamp measurements (Borg-Graham et al., 1998; Leinekugel et al., 2002) to measure maps of sensory-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in the developing (PND 8–18) barrel cortex.
17334362	17	In contrast, thalamocortical excitatory currents rose slowly in excitatory cells, overlapping with feedforward inhibitory currents that suppress action potentials.
21753015	313	Pc2 of facilitating response was found to be signifiresults suggest that spatial configurations of presynaptic axons cantly larger than Pc1 (p 0.01, n 15 in corticopontine cells/corticopontine cells and n 2 in and postsynaptic dendrites are similar between corticopontine cells/corticopontine cells and crossed-corticostriatal/crossed-corticostriatal), while Pc2 of depressing response was significantly crossed-corticostriatal/crossed-corticostriatal cells, and that the higher reciprocity found in corticopontine cells/corticopontine cells smaller than Pc1 (p 0.05, n 2 in corticopontine cells/corticopontine cells, n 6 in crossed-corticostriatal/ pairs reflects synaptic selectivity rather than morphological differ- crossed-corticostriatal, and n 4 in crossed-corticostriatal/corticopontine cells) (Fig. 9B), further suggesting that ences in dendritic and axonal extents.
22171028	155	After the adenoviral vector was injected with the vehicle containing 0.6 M NaCl (Tomioka and Rockland, 2006) into the ventrobasal thalamic complex of rats, a band of L6 neurons in the somatosensory cortex was retrogradely labeled (Fig. 1 B, C).

9570781	258	The predicted high density of Ih in the apical dendrite of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons may also play an important role in regulating the extent with which regenerative events generated in the distal apical dendrites (Schiller et al., 1997; Stuart et al., 1997a) propagate to the soma and axon (Schwindt and Crill, 1997).
19641119	323	Interestingly, this is the same theta phase when pyramidal cells and parvalbumin /calbindin basket cells in the prelimbic area of the medial prefrontal cortex are firing most.

21753015	402	corticopontine cells subgroups could amplify their spiking activities using the temporal properties of facilitation, higher reciprocal connectivity, and their intrinsic firing properties.
19914188	53	Analysis of covariance revealed that this did not simply reflect a common effect of cell class (p < 0.0001), suggesting that sparseness was correlated between stimulus types even within neurons of a single morphological class.
17317752	359	It is more likely that simultaneous action potential activity in these layers results, at least during the initial 10–20 ms after a sensory stimulus, from excitation via ventral posterior medial nucleus afferents, which is then followed by sequential activation by intracolumnar radial projections from layer 4 cells (Mountcastle, 1957; Johnson & Alloway, 1995; Laaris et al. 2000; Ahissar et al. 2001).
21704132	390	In line with this possibility are the observations that simple cells tend to be preferentially clustered in layer 4 in rats (Parnavelas et al., 1983), but not in mice (Niell and Stryker, 2008).

18466749	66	However, we observed that fast-spiking cells in barrel cortex often exhibited a prominent delay to first spikes near ITH (Figures 1A and 2A and Figure S1), a feature noted to be particularly frequent among (but not unique to) fast-spiking cells in supragranular layers.
21451062	547	Expression of Kv1.1, a Shaker-like potassium channel, is temporally regulated in embryonic neurons and glia.
18466749	141	Application of dendrotoxin-I or dendrotoxin-K also abolished the acceleration of firing frequency during the initial phase of sustained fast-spiking cell discharge (Figures 3D and 3E).
18216227	342	This would be difficult to accomplish by UV uncaging of glutamate, which induces large direct currents in large areas near the recorded cell (Douglas and Martin 2004).

14673000	231	Because dopamine has been shown to reduce calcium channel activation in the prefrontal cortex (Yang and Seamans, 1996) as well as other cells types (Sah and Bean, 1994), we suspected that dopamine might depress dendritic calcium transients generated by backpropagating action potentials.

15217339	51	However, applied to the cortex, this method was evidently hindered by the plethora of different cell types found in cortex, which formed “impenetrable thickets” (Ramon y Cajal 1937) of connections.

9007187	556	Mean soma sizes of Parvalbumin+ and calretinin+ neurones were significantly different (Table 1).
9570781	255	A recent study in hippocampal pyramidal neurons has found that the density of a transient, A-type potassium conductance is also higher in the distal apical dendrites than at the soma and more proximal regions (Hoffman et al., 1997).
15987765	339	These morphological types of interneurons correspond to basket cells, which constitute a substantial number of inhibitory synapses on soma and proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells (Somogyi et al. 1983; Tamas et al. 2003).
21753015	101	Different EPSC characteristics between corticopontine cells/corticopontine cells and crossed-corticostriatal/crossed-corticostriatal connections.
10884314	272	It may be speculated that in layer 2/3 excitation arriving from layer 4 is distributed by pyramidal cell axons throughout the primary somatosensory cortex in vertical and horizontal directions (for review, see DeFelipe and Farinas, 1992).
14960603	29	The efficacy of synaptic connections between pyramids and bitufted cells is low (Reyes et al., 1998), but EPSPs strongly facilitate during repetitive (10 Hz) pyramidal cell activity (Markram et al., 1998; Reyes et al., 1998; Rozov et al., 2001), suggesting that cortical inhibition via bitufted interneurons operates predominantly during repetitive stimulation of the afferent sensory pathways.
21753015	198	The EPSC latency, rise time, and decay time conCPn/corticopontine cells connections, crossed-corticostriatal/crossed-corticostriatal connections showed a steeper restant were not dependent on the presynaptic or postsynaptic pylationship between EPSC variability (coefficient of variation) and amplitude (p 0.01, ramidal cell subtype (Table 1).
15101088	138	For example, the T1.vivo group (CA1 pyramidal cells injected in live Sprague-Dawley rats and reconstructed in Turner's laboratory) was compared with T1.young (same cell class and laboratory, but injected in slices and from a different rat strain), to T3 (same laboratory and injection method, but different morphological class, CA3), and to G1 (same morphological class and injection method, but different laboratory).
9592109	59	Cortical cell responses were reported as average spike rate recorded at the cell body over the 500 msec stimulus period, excluding the 50 msec initial transient (because few spikes occurred during this period in the isolated cell model).
22593736	114	Hence the regularity of spiking by layer 6 pyramidal neurons decreased with decreasing temperature.

9453672	152	Until the backward system of corticocortical projections was widely recognized, excitatory inputs to layer I were believed to originate either locally from nonpyramidal neurons (see, e.g., Martinotti cells, Szentagothai, 1978) or extrinsically from the thalamus outside the specific sensory nuclei (i.e., "nonspecific" projections; Herkenham, 1986).
20927409	386	To process incoming information, cortical neurons embedded in a network utilize coding strategies relying either on the average rate of AP firing or on the exact (millisecond range) spike timing of several neurons firing synchronously [83].

14960603	288	When EPSPs were suprathreshold and evoked an AP, which occurred 177 60 msec after the onset of presynaptic stimulation (n 91 trials from 12 cell pairs), the peak [Ca 2 ]i increased approximately twofold (Fig. 10 E).
22002739	143	During P0–2, 40.3% (52 in 129) of subplate neurons were single spiking type and the percentage was similar to a previous study (33%, Hanganu et al. 2001).
20927409	355	As suggested previously for hippocampal 2+ CCK-positive basket cells, the effect of the slow Ca buffer may 2+ result from a reduction of the long-lasting presynaptic Ca transient following repeated stimulations [20].
21704132	78	After capacitance compensation, a ramp of negative pressure usually led to whole-cell configuration.
18466749	268	phenomena were eliminated by dendrotoxin-K: after application of 50 nM dendrotoxin-K, fast-spiking cells fired spikes in response to the first cycle in the series, did so at lower values of ITH application, and did not exhibit phase advancement during the series.
17334362	22	Each pair consisted of one fast-spiking inhibitory interneuron (FS cell) and one regular-spiking excitatory neuron (RS cell), both of which received direct (monosynaptic) thalamic input (Methods and Fig.
21286222	113	These neurons fall into two groups: four with strong burst spiking patterns (black), in which ISI is 3–4 comparable to ISI , and six with weak burst spiking patterns (gray), in which 1–2 ISI is comparable at the two temperatures.
9592109	159	In these runs, 100 excitatory synapses from LGN were used to drive the cortical cell in lieu of the 1024 inputs used in the runs of Figure 4. Tuning was evaluated with a relatively short, wide background of 0 (18 × 7).
15115747	25	The experiments are complemented with a minimal model using two compartments that can fully account for the observed gain modulation and association capabilities of L5 pyramidal neurons.
16457955	145	Thus, we used the same methodology to facilitate the comparison of the information obtained with that established in other species, and to determine how the phenotypes of pyramidal neurons vary in different cortical areas and species.
20927409	369	A presynaptic washout of metabolic compounds in the intra-terminal cytoplasm during the first minutes of whole-cell recording is highly unlikely, as indicated by the timing (tens of minutes) required for 10 mM BAPTA and 10 mM EGTA to reach presynaptic sites and block asynchronous release.

21880904	150	In the feline and primate visual system, dendritic arbors of cortical neurons have been shown to respect the boundaries of ocular dominance columns (Katz et al., 1989; Kossel et al., 1995).
18466749	275	fast-spiking cells in layer 2/3 mouse barrel cortex express Kv1.1-containing potassium channels that are specifically localized to the axon initial segment and exert a major influence on the excitability of fast-spiking cells via regulation of AP threshold and near-threshold responsiveness.
15737062	236	With a connection probability of 0.11, each neuron receives inputs from 44 others.
20720120	360	This arrangement suggests that entorhinal cortex5 cells communicate mainly with their peers within the supplemental material layer through the basal dendrites and with progressively fewer neurons in entorhinal cortex3 toward the surface, contributing few axons to entorhinal cortex2–entorhinal cortex1 (van Haeften et al., 2003; Kloosterman et al., 2003, 2004).
16093380	83	Neurons clearly identified as excitatory regular-spiking cells and inhibitory low-threshold spiking cells were included in these analyses.

16793907	381	Conclusions The major aim of the present study in conjunction with our previous work on the anatomical and functional connectivity of different classes of neurones in the barrel cortex is to delineate how a simple sensory stimulus, a brief whisker deflection, is encoded by PSPs and APs in layer 2/3 and to quantify the anatomical and functional determinants of the respective representational maps.
7904301	7	Axons arising from layer V provide monosynaptic input to pyramidal cells in all layers of neighboring columns, by synapsing in two dendritic fields: one in the superficial layers and the other in middle layer V.
9007187	830	By contrast, g-aminobutyric acid+ neurones composed 20.6% (1 in 5) of all neurones in the visual cortex (area 17) of the cat (Gabbott and Somogyi, 1986).

14602839	31	In the first few days after birth, layer V pyramidal neurons had low resting potentials, high-input resistance, and long membrane time constant.
9880578	191	Fast application of GABA to outside-out patches of layer V pyramidal neurons After synaptic release, the neurotransmitter is thought to be present only very briefly at high concentration in the synaptic cleft (Clements et al., 1992).

17317752	195	We found very short onset latencies (9–13 ms) in a subset of layer 4 cells, in L5 thick-tufted cells and in L6 cells (Fig. 3E and, at higher time resolution, in Fig.
18971461	10	Interlaminar excitatory connections are direction-selective, with the information originating in thalamic-receptive neurons transmitted first to excitatory neurons in superficial layers, and then relayed to deeper layers (Bureau et al., 2006; Lu ̈ bke and Feldmeyer, 2007).

22002739	52	Input and series resistance was monitored continuously to evaluate the health of the neurons.
17122323	106	Cholinergic inhibition of pyramidal neurons was generally confined to cells in deeper cortical layers, with almost all layer 5 pyramidal neurons hyperpolarized by acetylcholine (29 of 30; mean response amplitude 4.4 3.0 mV, n 29).

17522314	329	In addition to the immunolesion of cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei neurons, an additional mechanism may account for the significant effects of saporin treatment, performed directly at birth, on the cortical activity.

18787231	30	This was however not the case: thus axonal projections represent an independent classifier of interneurons.

9592109	25	This kind of subunit pooling is of relevance well beyond the primary visual cortex, because the construction of receptive fields that grow progressively more stimulus specific, and more spatially invariant, roughly characterizes the transformation of the visual code from level to level in the form-processing cortical stream and culminates in cells in the inferotemporal complex with elaborate form preferences maintained over very large receptive fields (Ito et al., 1995).

11731554	295	Thus, based on electrophysiological criteria alone, it was not possible to determine whether N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors of layer V neurons were activated monosynaptically by callosal fibers or indirectly through other cortical neurons (Conti and Manzoni 1994).

16457955	51	Ninety pyramidal cells (15 cells per area and per mouse) were reconstructed to perform the Sholl analysis, and to quantify the branching pattern of neurons in the different cortical areas (Sholl, 1953) in both two- and three-dimensions (2-D and 3-D, respectively).
19295167	8	By clarifying the diversity of cortical Neuropeptide Y neurons, this study establishes a basis for future investigations aiming at elucidating their physiological roles.
17898147	307	Instead we find that corticotrigeminal and -thalamic neurons comprise largely discrete subpopulations of cortical neurons.
16467534	166	C, The voltage change required to reach AP threshold (top) and AP amplitude (bottom) measured from threshold in neurons with different axon lengths (21–968 m; n 108).
18787231	11	The shape of the soma, dendrite and axon geometry of nonpyramidal neurons is highly diverse, and numerous classifications have been suggested based on this diversity (Ramo ́ n y Cajal 1904; Lorente de No 1938; Szentagothai 1973; Jones 1975; Feldman and Peters 1978; Gibson et al. 1999; Cauli et al. 2000; Gupta et al. 2000).
21118703	104	Cultured neurons also tend to be stained at high contrast and therefore may be less challenging to skeletonize.
20927409	278	P-cell firing responses to frozen noise current injections were very precise with low failure rates (Figure 8A), as previously reported [3].
15456817	381	For the proportion of unassigned asymmetric synapses in layer receive is 11% and 6, there are several explanations: (1) there are missing pathways yet to be identified, (2) we underestimated the average synaptic contribution or the proportion of the cells that do project to these layers, and (3) less likely, the stereological counts (Beaulieu and Colonnier, 1985) are inaccurate.

22798946	19	The cell density in the barrel hollows is lower than in the barrel borders; barrel hollows contain a large fraction of the thalamocortical and intracortical axons, dendrites, the somata of some layer 4 neurons and possibly also glia (see e.g., Woolsey et al., 1975a; Lübke et al., 2000).

10980023	383	The sequential and recurrent propagation of action potentials at these latencies throughout the pyramidal cell population may explain the persistence of fast oscillations activity beyond the P1 peak well after thalamic afferents are waning.
17317752	204	This is also clear from the population peristimulus time histograms for these cell types when shown at higher time resolution (Fig. 4A), which shows that the average firing rates increased in layer 4, L6 and L5 thick-tufted cells almost simultaneously (see also Fig.
18787231	276	Methods), we conclude that the suggested classifications of interneurons by electrical excitability parameters could not predict the type of axonal projections.
22002739	82	After recording, the patch electrode was slowly elevated and withdrawn from the recorded cell, allowing the cell membrane to reseal.
20927409	68	Delayed and disorganized asynchronous inhibitory responses significantly affected the input–output properties of both fast-spiking and P neurons, suggesting that asynchronous release of GABA might promote network desynchronization.

21368112	167	However, thick-tufted neurons project more densely to infragranular layers of the principal and surrounding columns, explaining in part the broad sub- and suprathreshold receptive fields of thick-tufted neurons (19, 39, 47) and suggesting that output to subcortical targets from thick-tufted neurons may be less column- and therefore whisker-specific than that from slender-tufted neurons.
20927409	330	This is further supported by the described lack of firing in postsynaptic fast-spiking cells.
18216227	321	Using the value of p for each distance and a vertical con length of the layer 2/3 area of 339 18 m (mean SD, n 6 slices), we estimated the number of presynaptic pyramidal neurons for each distance (N ) in layer 2/3 as p con con cell (r2 r2 ) 339 (Fig. 6E).
22232599	106	Indeed, dual laminar flow (chamber volume <1 ml) considerably enhances oxygenation of deep slice layers at low perfusion rates (Figure 1B, left) improving, therefore, the endurance of neurons in these layers.
19914188	246	Our results suggest that similar principles may apply in auditory cortex: large L5tPCs, which show densest coding, form the principal subcortical output (Ojima et al., 1992), whereas the smaller L2/3Pyramidal cells employ the sparsest coding.

14602839	40	These findings suggest that the intrinsic properties of neurons and the properties of synaptic inputs develop concomitantly during early life.
21753015	347	Dendritic and axonal branching patterns were dependent on cell subtype as well as on sublaminar position of the cell body.
15456817	161	The four reconstructed smooth neurons of layer 2/3 formed an average of 6171 1964 synapses (Tama ́ s et al., 1997), of which 76 6% were located in layer 2/3 and only 10 5% in layer 4 (2 1% in layer 5 and 6, and 8 2% in layer receive is 11%).
19641119	274	Because juxtacellulalry labeled pyramidal cells were recorded mainly during theta oscillations and only few data could be obtained during spindle oscillations, these cells were not included in this analysis.

20927409	245	This suggests that fast-spiking cell properties may be modulated by their own output, long after spiking activity has ended.
17317752	297	In contrast, L5 thick-tufted cells showed significantly higher responses after surround whisker deflection (0.39 ± 0.12 APs per stimulus, repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction, P < 0.05 for all cell types).

17122323	312	In 11 of 16 neurons inhibited by focal acetylcholine application, the hyperpolarization was preceded by a fast depolarizing response (Fig. 10B ) that was sensitive to mecamylamine application (10 M; 2 n 4; data not shown).
9457640	116	These cells were chosen for this analysis so as to isolate the properties of back-propagating action potentials from those of dendritically initiated events.
16093380	177	This implies that the maturation of low-threshold spiking cell physiology is a major contributor to the abrupt appearance of the spike-synchronizing mechanism.

20927409	257	Indeed, although the cell resistance did not significantly decrease in the interval between stimulation periods compared to the before and after control conditions (162619 versus 140619 versus 161620 MV; p.0.05; Figure 7G), a prominent hyperpolarization was always present immediately after the spike trains.
14602839	252	Thus neurons at different ages are tuned to respond to the developmental changes in the properties of synaptic inputs.
18466749	61	We found that, on average, fast-spiking cells in layer 2/3 barrel cortex actually show spikes-frequency acceleration during sustained discharge.
20720120	443	Second, the release of the Vm from transient hyperpolarization can facilitate “rebound” spiking (Cobb et al., 1995), which may be particularly effective in neurons with prominent Ih (Alonso and Klink, 1993; Giocomo et al., 2007).

22171028	39	Neurons in the L4 barrel (300 – 400 m in diameter) and those in the other layers respond primarily to a single whisker, thus congregating in a vertical column extending across the cortical layers.
16793907	317	So far, layer 2/3 pyramidal cells have not been classified into morphologically distinct subgroups.
16093380	224	Although they make profuse GABAergic connections with both fast-spiking and regular-spiking cells, low-threshold spiking cells rarely inhibit one another, so electrical synapses are their primary means of interaction (Gibson et al., 1999).
17317752	250	We conclude that those cortical cells that receive direct ventral posterior medial nucleus input have reliable whisker-evoked responses relative to cells that are activated via other or additional pathways [intracortical and medical division of posterior nucleus (POm) inputs for L2/3 and L5 slender-tufted cells].
21753015	250	This indicates that the corticopontine cells population is composed of subgroups of mutually connected cells in the frontal cortex.

14645486	245	Similarly, in layer 2/3 of lateromedial area, asymmetric inputs to somatostatin neurons account for only 1.6% (8 of 505) of all asymmetric synapses.
22171028	319	Furthermore, a recent multiple whole-cell recording study of the mouse barrel cortex has reported cases of L4-to-L6 connections (3/93 pairs) and has also shown that EPSP amplitudes of these connections are sometimes much larger (0.17, 0.96, and 5.67 mV) than the typical EPSP amplitude in postsynaptic L6 neurons ( 0.2 mV) (Lefort et al., 2009).
9236245	214	Electrophysiological recordings in vitro were also unable to establish a clear relationship between cell morphology and intrinsic electrophysiological properties among these cell types (van Brederode and Snyder, 1992).
20720120	396	These observations suggest that the intrinsic properties of entorhinal cortex2 stellate neurons are tuned to resonate at theta frequency (Giocomo et al., 2007; Giocomo and Hasselmo, 2008).

21368112	217	Neuron tracings were performed on 100-μm-thick Vibratome sections cut approximately tangential to the D2 barrel column.
22593736	10	In contrast with layer 2/3 and layer 6 pyramidal neurons, layer 5 pyramidal neurons have been classified as intrinsically bursting or regularly firing (Connors et al., 1982; McCormick et al., 1985; Agmon and Connors, 1989; Chagnac-Amitai et al., 1990; Mason and Larkman, 1990).

14960603	28	The horizontal and vertical spread of their axon arbors suggests that bitufted cells can control the excitation within a cortical column and, possibly in the supragranular layers, also between columns (Kaiser et al., 2001).
15987765	207	We followed the previous morphological description (Lund and Lewis 1993) and grouped these cells based on their horizontal axonal spread into local (n 24), medium (n 26), and wide arbor cells (n 25) (Fig. 8).
8459275	346	The other group [high input-resistance layer V pyramidal cells, n = 81 had diameters smaller than 16 pm and input resistance >400 MQ.
15525762	305	Likewise, in layer I, neurogliaform-LS cells were highly coupled via electrical synapses among themselves but not to other interneurons exhibiting different patterns of firing (Chu et al., 2003).
21917809	309	The number of neurons contacted by each positive interneuron was 121 (80/8 1) 1331.
14645486	303	The preference for parvalbumin neurons over other types of interneurons argues against an interareal connectivity that is strictly determined by axonal density (Braitenberg and Schu ̈ z, 1998; Traczy-Hornoch et al., 1999). parvalbumin neurons were shown to be preferred targets in rat thalamocortical pathway (Staiger et al., 1996) and in feedback connections from layer 3 to 4 of cat visual cortex (Thomson et al., 2002).
15539396	341	Dendritic whole-cell (Fig. 9) and Ca2+ imaging (Figs 8 and 10) revealed that the modulation of the shape of the action potential recorded at the soma was echoed by changes to the shape of the b-action potential and to dendritic Ca2+ transients.

20927409	334	Secondly, asynchronous GABAergic events following a spike train in fast-spiking interneurons were also observed in connected P neurons and other postsynaptic fast-spiking interneurons, which did not fire action potentials and were held at hyperpolarized potentials.
19805321	393	Because L5B neurons, in comparison to L5A, have longer apical dendrites, with more extensive apical tufts, and larger numbers of oblique branches, the path lengths for actual synapses (L5B neurons) turned out to be significantly longer than those for potential synapses (L5A neurons).

18305253	102	An additional 117 layer 4 cells outside of hot spots were tested for connectivity, but no pairs were found, suggesting that layer 4 cells projecting to a single layer 2/3 target neuron exist iMK-801, no TBOA clusters; such clusters have been observed for intralaminar connections iMK-801, no TBOA L5 of visual cortex (Song et al., 2005) and iMK-801, no TBOA layer 4 and layer 2/3 of S1 (Feldmeyer et al., 1999, 2006) and for layer 4 –layer 2/3 connections iMK-801, no TBOA S1 (Feldmeyer et al., 2002).
19805321	164	This supposition is reasonable for L43L4 projection where unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials had been shown to elicit action potentials in spiny stellate neurons in the in vitro slice preparation (21).

17334362	191	These simulation results indicate that a substantial fraction (approximately 75%) of the cell-type difference in inhibitory suppression was due to differences in Ge-Gi overlap, resulting mostly from differences in Ge kinetics.

17478724	145	Finally, we attempted to demonstrate morphologically, using mechanically dissociated neurons from slices, that GABAergic terminals on the soma of layer-2/3 pyramidal neurons have nonNMDA receptors and that they are apposed by glutamatergic synaptic terminals.
17898147	170	Composition of cortical layer V Corticothalamic, corticotrigeminal, and callosal neurons are largely nonoverlapping subpopulations of layer V neurons.
15456817	134	For example, the layer 6 pyramidal cell depicted in Figure 3 formed almost all of its synapses in layer 4 (5536), 37 synapses in layer 6, 112 in layer 5, and 61 in layer 2/3.
21917809	372	Given that interneurons act as foreign invaders during development (Anderson et al., 1997), it is parsimonious that their wiring program may be relatively simple, without the need for mechanisms to specifically connect with existing pyramidal cell circuits.
15987765	83	Pyramidal cells with regular spiking properties were also included in the sample.
19805321	39	Hence, a given neuron may only connect to some of its (synaptically compatible) potential partners, establishing individual synaptic connections with them probabilistically and independently of one another.

22798946	206	In contrast to the intralaminar layer 4-layer 4 connection, layer 4-layer 2/3 connections are never reciprocal (Feldmeyer et al., 2002) and connections between presynaptic layer 2/3 pyramidal cells and layer 4 spiny neurons are extremely rare (Lefort et al., 2009).

21917809	13	Part of the reason for this ignorance is the experimental difficulty in revealing how these neurons are connected to each other to form functional circuits (Crick, 1979).
19474331	6	We found that the intrinsic and synaptic physiology of fast-spiking cells undergoes profound regulation over the first 4 postnatal weeks and that these changes are correlated with primarily monotonic but bidirectional transcriptional regulation of thousands of genes belonging to multiple functional classes.

22171028	1	However, the spatial organization of local excitatory connections to corticothalamic neurons is only partially understood.
9453672	100	Because the number of HRPlabeled fibers traced from the shown in C application site through the callosum appeared to be much greater than the number of filled cells found in the contralateral cortex, a substantial anterograde callosal projection from shown in C was apparently labeled directly by the layer I horseradish peroxidase application.
19474331	234	The two-pore potassium leak channels TWIK1 and TASK1 are upregulated in G42 fast-spiking interneurons over postnatal development and exert increasing influence on membrane excitability.
17334362	100	In summary, the stronger compound thalamocortical Ge amplitudes observed in FS cells appear to result from both stronger unitary conductances and greater numbers of thalamic inputs per FS cell.
9880578	278	The two duration distributions were significantly different in the six cells tested (Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test; p < 0.001).

19805321	211	Because dendritic and local axonal morphologies of neurons in these regions are similar (1), the distributions of potential synapse numbers for the considered projections were also similar in the barrel and septum-related columns.

15182718	257	Differences in methodology (e.g., slice thickness), sampling of layer 4 neurons (e.g., depth of cells within the slice), and analysis criteria (e.g., scoring or excluding cells with truncated axons) may account for the observed differences between the two studies.

16793907	119	As for synaptically coupled pairs between layer 4 spiny neurones and layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (and in contrast to pairs between spiny neurones in layer 4; Feldmeyer et al. 1999), pairs between layer 2/3 pyramidal cells showed a relatively low spontaneous synaptic activity (Feldmeyer et al. 2002) which facilitated the analysis of EPSPs and the detection of small EPSPs.
17698015	309	Post hoc reconstructions of axons of biocytin-filled cells (2 mg ml1, e.g., Figure 5A) indicated a strong positive correlation with these estimations (r2 = 0.986, p < 0.001, n = 7, data not shown) and slope close to 0.98.

15115747	336	Towards a Canonical Layer 5 Pyramidal Cell From the results shown in this paper a new picture emerges of how the layer 5 pyramidal cell with its distinct morphological features might operate in an in vivo situation (Fig. 8).
12900914	33	This organization may provide differential pathway-specific electrotonic filtering of synaptic inputs (Williams and Stuart, 2002) and make feedforward connections inputs to parvalbumin neurons more effective than feedback connections inputs.

15912501	368	For example, after using conventional light microscopy to show that corresponding whisker representations in MI and SI send overlapping projections to the neostriatum (Hoffer and Alloway, 2001), subsequent ultrastructural analysis confirmed that these corticostriatal projections converge on target neurons in the neostriatum (Ramanathan et al., 2002).
14960603	11	One subclass of interneurons, referred to as “bitufted,” somatostatin-positive interneurons (Kawaguchi, 1995; Reyes et al., 1998; Cauli et al., 2000) have their somata located mostly in supragranular layer 2/3.
21917809	152	This approach allowed for large-scale measurement of connectivity within one slice whereas past dual whole-cell recording that maintained single-cell accuracy necessitated comparisons across many different slices.
14960603	239	Therefore, we evoked a single backpropagating AP in the interneuron by somatic current injection coincident with synaptic stimulation.
17334362	98	This conclusion is further supported by our observation that thalamocortical EPSC thresholds in FS cells were either lower than or equal to thresholds in RS cells, but never higher (Fig. 3g).

9457640	299	That this is the case is clearly demonstrated by the experiments where triple whole-cell voltage recordings were made simultaneously from the dendrites, soma and axon of the same neuron (Fig. 11).
10884314	293	Based on the location of GABAergic synapses with excitatory principal neurons, interneurons have different functions, e.g., feedback–feedforward inhibition and suppression of dendritic C a 2+ spikes (Miles et al., 1996; Larkum et al., 1999).

15217339	43	Why this layer has specialized for the connection between distal dendrites and cortical and subcortical inputs is one of its mysteries, but the existence of layer 1 points to a general purpose of cortical lamination, which is to generate a scaffold that constrains the way in which neurons can connect.

16701210	14	A number of observations lend importance to dendritic inhibition: (1) upper cortical layers, in particular layer 1, are characterized by an extensive plexus of inhibitory axons (de Blas et al., 1988; Houser et al., 1983) that confer a major source of inhibition, whose disruption translates into hyperexcitability (Shlosberg et al., 2003); (2) excitatory cortical feedback projections to L1 (Cauller et al., 1998; Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Rockland and Pandya, 1979) not only contact other pyramidal neurons (Rockland and Pandya, 1979) but also L1 calretinin-positive and L2/3 parvalbumin-positive interneurons (Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1999; Gonchar and Burkhalter, 2003); (3) Ca2+ spikes are very susceptible to local inhibitory inputs, as a single action potential from one interneuron in L2/3 contacting a L5 pyramidal neuron have been shown to abolish dendritic Ca2+ spikes without affecting the generation or back propagation of axonally initiated Na+ APs (Larkum et al., 1999b).
12546824	48	Previous research in invertebrate (Segev and Parnas, 1983) and cultured hypothalamic (Gao et al., 1998) neurons indicates that depolarizing somatic GABA responses can also facilitate action potential generation if timed to occur prior to EPSP onset.
18466749	82	However, during sustained high-frequency discharge in response to suprathreshold current (continuous fast-spiking cell pattern), the voltage threshold for AP generation shifted to more hyperpolarized levels, to 43.9 ± 3.3 mV for the first spikes in continuous fast-spiking cell trains (n = 12; p < 0.01 versus dFS firing mode).

18466749	112	These negative findings suggest that the basis of the slow depolarization seen in delay-type fast-spiking cells may be due to the slow inactivation of a K+ current.

7904301	298	Similarly, currents generated by orthodromically evoked action potentials may have a minor contribution to the CSDs due to the diphasic time function of the action potential currents (sink followed by a source at the level of the soma), which renders them very susceptible to cancellations by temporal scatter.
17698015	236	Role of the Axon Initial Segment The axon initial segment defines the initial unmyelinated region of the axon (Sloper and Powell, 1979) that contains the site of AP initiation in cortical pyramidal neurons (Palmer and Stuart, 2006; Shu et al., 2006a).
18466749	372	To identify fast-spiking cells, we searched for densely Kv1-immunolabeled neurons that lacked pyramidal morphology and that also possessed a cytoplasm rich in mitochondria (a known feature of parvalbumin-positive interneurons; Kita et al., 1990; Chow et al., 1999).

22798946	226	Most pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 have axonal domains that exhibit a “butterfly” appearance: a long stem axon that runs down into the white matter and has several long-range collaterals projecting horizontally mainly in L5A and L5B pyramidal neurons 2/3 and 5 over the entire barrel field in somatosensory and into the ipsilateral S2 and motor cortex while sparing layer 4 almost completely (Figure 5A; Feldmeyer et al., 2006; Larsen and Callaway, 2006; Bruno et al., 2009; Aronoff et al., 2010, see also below).

19295167	705	Together, their differential connectivity and pharmacological profile indicate that fast-spiking-parvalbumin, adapting somatostatin, and adapting Neuropeptide Y neurons constitute three functionally distinct populations of Neuropeptide Y interneurons that now can be easily identified in acute slices within a few minutes of whole-cell recording.

22114282	203	When absolute values of the ODIs were paired tested, in all cell types, the ocular preference was sharper at the action potential activity level compared with postsynaptic potential responses [signed-rank paired tests, *p 0.01, (*)p 0.07], with the noticeable exception of 5TPs ( p 0.35).
17717695	201	In summary, connections between pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 may integrate and subsequently distribute excitatory signals arriving from layer 4 across laminar and columnar borders (Fig. 7).

17317752	372	Accordingly, we separated L5 cells into slender- and thick-tufted pyramids and found major differences in spontaneous activity, evoked activity, latency and receptive field size.
12037194	95	Evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials are summated linearly in postsynaptic neurons, and the kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic potentials are identical in all neurons for all connections (this idealized excitatory postsynaptic potential was chosen from 1 experiment).
20927409	421	To quantify activitydependent asynchronous responses, a train stimulation protocol was run several times for each cell, and sIPSC frequency increases were normalized by calculating the ratio of event frequencies recorded in the test period (0.5–1 s) immediately after the AP trains to events recorded during the baseline period (7 s before 2/2 trains).
19914188	70	The results of this analysis were again consistent with the examples of Figure 1B: predictability measured in bits per spike was highest in L2/3 Pyramidal cells (Figure 2C), consistent with sharpest tuning in these neurons; L6 Pyramidal cells typically carried little information about tone identity (Figure 2C).
17122323	121	Application of acetylcholine resulted in hyperpolarizing responses in all neurons tested (Fig. 2A) with responses in prefrontal neurons being of somewhat larger in amplitude and duration than in neurons in other areas of cortex (Fig. 2B; ANOVA, P 0.01 and P 0.05 for amplitude and 1/2-width, respectively, when compared with responses in somatosensory neurons; Table 1). Bath application of apamin completely blocked all hyperpolarizing responses (mean response in apamin 1.6 1.6 mV, n 22), suggesting a common ionic mechanism mediates cholinergic inhibition in pyramidal neurons throughout the cortex (Fig. 2B).

12746859	369	Also, even in the few cases (two of the five cells) where there was a dendrite of a slightly larger diameter than average stemming from the apical part of the soma, it was not as prominent as the apical dendrites of the larger pyramidal neurons.

17898147	152	Callosal neurons in the primary visual cortex do not send collaterals to the superior colliculus (Hallman et al. 1988), suggesting that callosal neurons may also be largely nonoverlapping with other lower layer V corticofugal neurons including corticothalamic and -trigeminal neurons.
15525762	288	Interestingly, cannabinoid receptor-1 expression has also been reported in a population of calbindin-expressing neurons (Marsicano and Lutz, 1999; Tsou et al., 1999; Bodor et al., 2003).

12514205	278	Lack of dye coupling among electrically coupled cells has been observed previously (Gibson et al., 1999) (for review, see Galarreta and Hestrin, 2001b) and may be related to the low conductance of individual gap junction channels (Srinivas et al., 1999).

12456830	278	We think that this difference is largely due to insufficient space-clamp since excitatory synapses are not on somata of layer II pyramidal cells (Larkman, 1991) and because we did not routinely compensate series resistance or electrode and whole-cell capacitance.

22593736	299	Nonetheless our conclusion, that electrical coupling between soma and dendrite affect the spiking of pyramidal neurons, is likely to apply in vivo, where ongoing synaptic activity may dynamically alter the electrical properties of the dendritic tree and thereby the coupling between soma and dendrite.
22171028	258	Within a neuron group, when a neuron on average sends a certain amount of axon boutons onto CTN dendrites in a given volume, depicted as the green rectangular prism in Figure 8 A (middle), these CTN dendrites are expected to receive the same amount of axon boutons from each neuron located at the same distance from them in all directions (Fig. 8 A, bottom) according to the above three suppositions.
12456830	139	These differences may be due to a poorer space-clamp in CA1 cells, as in this paired data they had a lower Ri (250 ± 220 MV) than layer II neurones (340 ± 90 MV).
8459275	360	Spike width was similar between low input-resistance and high input-resistance cells and 1.2 to 1.4 ms at half amplitude, which were larger than those of both types of nonpyramidal cells.

18216227	288	To determine whether the decrease in q was due to the decrease in the contribution of the strong connections, we excluded excitatory postsynaptic currents whose amplitudes were included in the top 10% for each recorded cell and examined the distribution of the mean amplitudes of the remainder (q ).

15456817	329	These weak projections form on average 98 78 synapses with a target neuron.
18787231	368	Therefore, electrical excitability and dendritic geometry cannot be considered as independent classifiers of interneurons.
22798946	309	In contrast, thick-tufted pyramidal cells are mainly found in sublamina B of layer 5 where also most of the untufted pyramidal cells are found (Larsen and Callaway, 2006).

17717695	263	Within layer 6, two major subtypes of pyramidal neurons exist with respect to their structural and functional properties (Mercer et al. 2005; Zarrinpar and Callaway 2006; Zhang and Deschene^s 1998): cortico-cortical projecting (i.e. with long horizontal intracortical axons confined to infragranular layers) and cortico-thalamic projecting (i.e. those projecting to different thalamic nuclei) pyramidal cells.

9007187	906	Although the dendritic processes of these inhibitory neurones, which include basket neurones and axoaxonic cells, freely cross laminar boundaries, their central distribution in the cortex may reflect their fundamental contribution to the functional operation of these lamina, especially since thalamocortical (Kuroda et al., 1995a) and other afferent systems (e.g., hippocampal, ventral tegmental area, and to some extent, amygdalocortical input to medial prefrontal cortex) are known to ramify predominantly in layers 3 and 5 (Ruit and Neafsey, 1990; Jay and Witter, 1991; Carr and Sesack, 1996; Bacon et al., 1996; Kuroda et al., 1996).

17898147	248	In response to a series of depolarizing currents, corticothalamic and -trigeminal cells have relatively uniform mean firing rates.
15987765	132	Both histograms suggest the presence of several subgroups of neurons, although the boundaries between the subgroups are obscured because of a considerable overlap of values in the potential subgroups of neurons.
20927409	322	This rapid mode of action is incompatible with our observation that high concentrations of either BAPTA or EGTA in the recording pipette blocked delayed self-inhibition in fast-spiking cells slowly (tens of minutes), which is inconsistent with a rapid somatodendritic diffusion of these compounds.
22798946	264	They establish between two and four synaptic contacts at a mean geometric distance ∼90 μm from the postsynaptic layer 2/3 pyramidal cell soma; the majority of these synaptic contacts can be found on basal dendrites with a few contacts being formed with proximal apical oblique dendrites (Feldmeyer et al., 2006).

18971461	31	In L5 pyramidal cells, a major source of subcortical projections, dendritic morphologies are correlated with their axonal projection targets and their firing patterns in some cortical areas (Chagnac-Amitai et al., 1990; Mason and Larkman, 1990; Hefti and Smith, 2000; Gao and Zheng, 2004; Morishima and Kawaguchi, 2006; Hattox and Nelson, 2007), suggesting that physiologically identified subtypes of L5 pyramidal cells sharing similar physiological characteristics represent functional output classes.

21880904	173	Inhibitory neurons play an important role in the cortical circuit, modulating the temporal response properties of excitatory neurons (Singer, 1996; McBain and Fisahn, 2001) and enhancing their ability to participate in spike timing-dependent plasticity (Dan and Poo, 2004; Foeller and Feldman, 2004).
