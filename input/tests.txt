In contrast, neurons in the hilus and in layer III of the entorhinal cortex were not protected
 including cortical interneurones, hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurones, the anterior thalamic reticular nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje neurones. 
Intracellular recordings from neurobiotin-labeled cells in brain slices of the rat medial nucleus of the trapezoid body.

the three GAD-positive rat neurons were non-accommodating (see Fig. 4C), while the one GAD-negative
rat neuron exhibited spike accommodation (data not shown). 
twelve neurons classified as FS cells were immunopositive for parvalbumin
 Schiess et al. (1999) classified CeA neurons as either type A (no accommodation) or type B (with accommodation). Our results are consistent with this classification of CeA cells and their general morphology, showing that non-accommodating type A cells are smaller than accommodating type B cells, but the two types have overlapping shapes
 Both glutamate and GABA synaptic transmission in CeA neurons have been characterize

#Straightforward examples of neuron mentions. Bold the neuron types.
Watermaze learning enhances excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons.

#Examples where a specific neuron type is mentioned along with its brain region. Bold the neuron type plus its region as a single phrase:
Similar to pyramidal cells in piriform cortex,...
In contrast, LVA Ca2+ channel-evoked CICR was absent from ventrolateral thalamocortical relay neurons,...
We have also investigated the function of mGluR2 in granule cells of the accessory olfactory bulb by combining...

#Example of a neuron reference through a previously used acronym:
We have also investigated the function of mGluR2 in granule cells of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB GCs)... AOB GCs differ from other cells of their brain in their properties... <tag AOB GCs in this case>

#Example where 2 neuron types are mentioned, conjoined by an “and”. In this case, bold the entire phrase:
A-type K+ current of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area.
In cross-correlation plots, thalamic and reticular nucleus neurons did not show a statistically significant relationship...

#Examples of a complicated mention of a single neuron type:
Thus the ventromedial hypothalamus-projecting neurons in the medial amygdala differ from...
Kv3.1 subunits are specifically found in fast-spiking, parvalbumin (PV)-containing cortical interneurons, and recent studies

#Example where multiple neuron types are mentioned as a single phrase. Bold the entire phrase:
Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings of GABA-evoked responses were conducted in neurons isolated from ventrobasal thalamus, nucleus reticularis thalami, and somatosensory cortex

#Some mentions will be very ambiguous, do not tag these:
We conclude that when the Ca2+ influx into the pre- or postsynaptic cell (don’t tag post-synaptic cell)
